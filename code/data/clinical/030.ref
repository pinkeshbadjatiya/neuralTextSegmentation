Cholesterol  triglycerides  and high density lipoproteins are important constituents of the lipid fraction of the human body 
Cholesterol is an unsaturated alcohol of the steroid family of compounds  it is essential for the normal function of all animal cells and is a fundamental element of their cell membranes 
It is also a precursor of various critical substances such as adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones and bile acids 
Triglycerides are fatty acid esters of glycerol and represent the main lipid component of dietary fat and fat depots of animals 
Cholesterol and triglycerides  being nonpolar lipid substances insoluble in water  need to be transported in the plasma associated with various lipoprotein particles 
Plasma lipoproteins are separated by hydrated density  electrophretic mobility  size  and their relative content of cholesterol  triglycerides  and protein into five major classes  chylomicrons  very low density lipoproteins VLDL  intermediate density lipoproteins IDL  low density lipoproteins LDL  and high density lipoproteins HDL 
Since the levels of plasma lipids have a bell shaped distribution in the general population  the definition of either a high or a low value of these substances has remained an arbitrary statistical decision 
High values have been traditionally considered as those in the th and th percentiles  low values were considered to be those below the th percentile 
The NIH Concensus Conference has recently revised the values concerning cholesterol  however  in view of clear evidence of an increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis in persons falling in the th to th percentiles 
According to this last statement  cholesterol levels below  mgdl are classified as desirable blood cholesterol  those  to  mgdl as borderline high blood cholesterol  and those  mgdl and above as high blood cholesterol

Analysis of plasma or serum total cholesterol  triglycerides  and lipoproteins is usually performed on blood specimens obtained by venipuncture in tubes containing EDTA 
Because of a larger content of water  plasma levels have been found to be around  lower than matched serum levels 
Cholesterol levels are fairly constant  but triglyceride levels fluctuate considerably from day to day and are highest  to  hours after meals 
Collection of blood for triglyceride testing should be done after a  hour fasting period  when chylomicrons have ordinarily been cleared from the circulation 
Measurements must be ideally done while the patients are on their usual diet and taking no medications that could alter blood lipid levels 
Sampling should not be performed during periods of stress or within  weeks after a major illness  such as an acute myocardial infarction  as plasma cholesterol may be reduced and triglyceride levels increased in these instances 
The standard chemical determination for plasma cholesterol is the Abell Kendall A K technique  which involves the Liebermann Burchardt reaction after hydrolysis and extraction of cholesterol 
Samples for plasma cholesterol and triglyceride determinations are commonly analyzed by completely automated methods at clinical laboratories 
As the results obtained at commercial laboratories differ systematically from those obtained by research methods  it is advisable to inquire how the method used by the particular laboratory compares with reference values  and to employ the same laboratory facility for serial measurements 
The best reference values available today for North American populations are those obtained in the Lipid Research Clinics Program  which surveyed   Americans aged  to  in the United States and Canada 
Reference values for plasma total cholesterol were obtained by utilizing autoanalyzer systems to which either the ferric chloride sulfuric acid method or the Liebermann Burchardt test was adapted 
A fluorometric analysis was utilized to determine triglyceride reference values 
Plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL C determination in this program was measured by the same procedures used for plasma total cholesterol  after precipitation of apoprotein B containing lipoproteins in whole plasma LDL and VLDL by heparin manganese chloride 
A useful additional test is examination of a refrigerated sample of fasting plasma at °C  chylomicrons  if present  form a creamy layer at the top of the test tube 
This test could help to distinguish type  hyperlipoproteinemia creamy layer on top with clear infranatant from type  hyperlipoproteinemia creamy layer on top with turbid infranatant 
Lipoproteins can be separated by ultracentrifugation  precipitation  and electrophoresis 
Lipoprotein fractions can be quantified by preparative or density adjusted ultracentrifugation 
This method is usually employed in elaborate studies and not as a routine clinical tool 
The quantitative reference method employs precipitation and ultracentrifugation sequentially to determine each lipoprotein component 
Usually  measurement of plasma lipid levels is sufficient for evaluation of patterns of lipoprotein elevations 
Occasionally paper electrophoresis of the plasma is helpful 
The correspondence of electrophoretic fractions with lipoproteins is shown in Table 
Quantitative determination of apoproteins is performed in sophisticated laboratories utilizing radioimmunoassays for apoprotein AI and apoprotein B and isoelectric focusing for apoproteins C and E 
Other specialized tests are   the intravenous heparin test for determination of postheparin lipolytic activity this test measures the preheparin and postheparin liberation of lipoprotein lipase and is principally used to confirm congenital lipoprotein lipase deficiency  and  evaluation of LDL receptor status on cultured skin fibroblasts or isolated lymphocytes 
==========
Plasma lipoprotein particles contain variable proportions of four major elements  cholesterol  triglycerides  phospholipids and specific proteins called apoproteins Table 
An alphabetical nomenclature A  B  C  D  E 
is generally used to designate the apoproteins 
The varying composition of these elements determines the density  size  and electrophoretic mobility of each particle 
These factors in turn have been used for the clinical and biochemical classification of lipoprotein disorders 
Schematically  lipoproteins have been described as globular or spherical units in which a nonpolar core lipid consisting mainly of cholesterol esters and triglycerides is surrounded by a layer containing phospholipids  apoproteins  and small amounts of unesterified cholesterol 
Apoproteins  in addition to serving as carrier proteins  have other important functions such as being co factors for enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism  acting as specific ligands for binding of the particles to cellular receptor sites  and intervening in the exchange of lipid constituents between lipoprotein particles 
The fact that all the cholesterol required by the body can be produced by biosynthesis points to the essential nature of this substance 
As an estimated loss of 
to 
g of cholesterol occurs daily through desquamation and fecal loss  this amount must be replaced 
Usually this replacement is obtained from dietary sources  but another portion is synthesized in multiple cells of the body 
Triglycerides are also obtained from the diet as well as synthesized by the liver 
The origin of circulating lipoproteins is less understood than is their uptake  transport  and degradation 
The lipid transport system in plasma has been described as involving two pathways  an exogenous route for the transport of cholesterol and triglycerides absorbed from dietary fat in the intestine  and an endogenous system through which cholesterol and triglycerides reach the plasma from the liver and other nonintestinal tissues Figure 
The exogenous pathway starts with the intestinal absorption of triglycerides and cholesterol from dietary sources 
Its end result is the transfer of triglycerides to adipose and muscle tissue and of cholesterol to the liver 
After absorption  triglycerides and cholesterol are re esterified in the intestinal mucosal cells and then coupled with various apoproteins  phospholipids  and unesterified cholesterol into lipoprotein particles called chylomicrons 
The chylomicrons in turn are secreted into intestinal lymph  enter the bloodstream through the thoracic  duct  and bind to the wall of capillaries in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue 
At these binding sites the chylomicrons interact with the enzyme lipoprotein lipase  which causes hydrolysis of the triglyceride core and liberation of free fatty acids 
These fatty acids then pass through the capillary endothelial cells and reach the adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells for storage or oxidation  respectively 
After removal of the triglyceride core  remnant chylomicron particles are formed 
These are high in cholesterol esters and characterized by the presence of apoproteins B  CIII  and E 
These remnants are cleared from the circulation by binding of their E apoprotein to a receptor present only on the surface of hepatic cells 
Subsequently  the bound remnants are taken to the inside of hepatic cells by endocytosis and then catabolized by lysosomes 
This process liberates cholesterol  which is then either converted into bile acids  excreted in bile  or incorporated into lipoproteins originated in the liver VLDL 
Under normal physiologic conditions  chylomicrons are present in plasma for  to  hours after a meal and may give it a milky appearance 
They are usually cleared from the circulation after a  hour fast 
The liver constantly synthesizes triglycerides by utilizing as substrates free fatty acids and carbohydrates  these endogenous triglycerides are secreted into the circulation in the core of very low density lipoprotein particles VLDL 
The synthesis and secretion of VLDL at cellular level occur in a process similar to that of chylomicrons  except that a different B apoprotein B  instead of B  together with apoproteins C and E intervene in their secretion 
Subsequent interaction of the VLDL particles with lipoprotein lipase in tissue capillaries leads to hydrolysis of the core triglycerides and production of smaller remnant VLDL particles rich in cholesterol esters intermediate density lipoproteins  IDL and liberation of free fatty acids 
Around half of these remnant particles are removed from the circulation in  to  hours as they bind tightly to hepatic cells 
The rest undergo modifications with detachment of the remaining triglycerides and its substitution by cholesterol esters and removal of all the apoproteins except apoprotein B 
This process results in transformation of the remnant VLDL particles into low density lipoprotein particles LDL rich in cholesterol 
In fact  these last particles contain around three fourths of the total cholesterol in human plasma  although they constitute only some  of the total cholesterol pool 
Their predominant function is to supply cholesterol to cells with LDL receptors  like those in the adrenal glands  skeletal muscle  lymphocytes  gonads  and kidneys 
The quantity of cholesterol freed from LDL is said to control cholesterol metabolism in the cell through the following mechanisms   increased LDL cholesterol in the cell decreases synthesis of the enzyme  hydroxy  methylglutaryl coenzyme A HMG CoA reductase  which modulates the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol   increased LDL cholesterol may enhance the storage of cholesterol within the cell by activation of another enzyme  and  increased cholesterol within the cell diminishes the synthesis of LDL receptors through a negative feedback process 
Besides the above described route for LDL degradation in extrahepatic sites  a so called scavenger cell pathway has been described 
This consists of cells in the reticuloendothelial system which  by phagocytosis  dispose of the excess concentrations of this lipoprotein in plasma 
High density lipoproteins are a heterogeneous group of macromolecules with different physical properties and chemical components  two subclasses of HDL have been identified HDL and HDL within which several subspecies have also been demonstrated 
The predomination function of HDL seems to be the reverse transport of cholesterol from different tissues into the liver  where it is eventually removed 
Subclass HDL has been reported to have a better correlation with coronary artery disease protection than total HDL cholesterol 
The serum concentration of HDL and its components derives from various complex intravascular and cellular metabolic events 
These events include secretion of precursor HDL particles from the liver and small intestine  interaction of these particles with lipids and proteins released during the catabolism of triglyceride rich lipoproteins  and production of cholesteryl esters the core substance in HDL from the action of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase LCAT  an enzyme that originates in the liver 
This enzyme acts on unesterified cholesterol released into plasma from cellular turnover 
The cholesterol esters formed in this reaction are in turn transferred to VLDL and subsequently appear in LDL 
The end result is a system that allows the transfer of cholesterol through LDL to peripheral cells and its return to the liver through HDL  and that prevents excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the body 
==========
Cholesterol and triglycerides  like many other essential components of the body  attract clinical attention when present in abnormal concentrations 
Increased or decreased levels usually occur because of abnormalities in the synthesis  degradation  and transport of their associated lipoprotein particles 
When hyperlipidemia or hypolipidemia are defined in terms of the class or classes of increased or decreased plasma lipoproteins  the names hyperlipoproteinemia or hypolipoproteinemia are preferentially employed 
Hyperlipoproteinemia is the lipid disturbance of major relevance clinically because of its association with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
Multiple epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that increased levels of plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoproteins are strongly and directly related to a greater incidence of coronary heart disease 
Elevated plasma triglycerides and very low density lipoproteins are directly associated with the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease  although not as independent risk factors 
In contrast  high levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol have been found to be a protective factor for the development of that disease  so that decreased levels constitute a risk factor 
Clinical manifestations of hyperlipoproteinemia include a greater incidence of ischemic vascular disease  acute pancreatitis  and visible accumulations of lipid deposits xanthomas and xanthelasmas 
The localization of these lesions is of great help in many instances to categorize the lipoprotein dysfunction present 
Increased concentration of plasma lipids is etiologically related mainly to genetic disorders  dietary factors such as ingestion of excessive calories  saturated fatty acids and cholesterol  or ingestion of drugs  or it may occur as a secondary phenomenon in a large variety of diseases 
In any of these instances the elevation of the different plasma lipoproteins usually occurs in a number of combinations that have led to their classification into six different patterns or phenotypes Table 
Genetic or acquired disorders may be related to one or more of these lipoprotein patterns  so the identification of a particular pattern gives no specific information regarding the cause of the hyperlipidemic disorder in question 
A practical approach is to classify the different hyperlipidemic  states into those that mainly cause hypercholesterolemia Table 
or those that predominantly cause hypertriglyceridemia Table 
In each of these categories primary genetic as well as secondary disorders are included 
The genetic disorders in turn could result from a single gene disturbance either of dominant or recessive inheritance  or a polygenic derangement in which multiple genes interact with environmental factors 
The main characteristics of primary hyperlipoproteinemias are included in Table 
For the diagnosis of the different lipoprotein disorders  one can usually rely on simple plasma values of total cholesterol and triglycerides 
These measurements should be repeated at least once  so as to obtain a more reliable estimate of the patient's level 
Obtained lipid values should be interpreted in relation to age and sex according to reference values established by the Lipid Research Clinics Program Tables 
As stated previously  the diagnosis of hyperlipidemia is based on arbitrary reference values above the th percentile for the distribution of cholesterol  triglyceride or LDL cholesterol for a given population 
Low reference values th percentile for the distribution of cholesterol  LDL and HDL identify persons with low lipid levels 
Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride values provide information concerning the lipoprotein particles that are increased 
Plasma cholesterol values represent total cholesterol  which includes both unesterified cholesterol and cholesteryl esters 
Isolated elevation of plasma cholesterol usually indicates that LDL is increased 
Isolated elevation of plasma triglyceride points to an elevation in chylomicrons  VLDL  andor remnants 
The bedside inspection of a refrigerated fasting plasma sample  the measurement of HDL cholesterol advisable if total plasma cholesterol is persistently elevated and the evaluation of associated clinical findings provide useful information 
In all cases  a detailed history and physical examination is imperative 
Evaluation and exclusion of secondary disorders  if necessary  could require additional laboratory tests as indicated in each particular case 
Screening of first degree relatives is advisable  especially if no secondary disorder is evident  as it may reveal a genetic problem 
Only in selected instances will special tests or lipoprotein electrophoresis be required for exact genotypic diagnosis 
Three primary disorders causing hypercholesterolemia have been identified 
They are   polygenic hypercholesterolemia   familial hypercholesterolemia  and  a variant of familial combined hyperlipidemia 
Polygenic hypercholesterolemia is the term utilized to describe the most common primary disorder causing an increase in plasma cholesterol 
It includes a group of related disorders in which multiple genes apparently interact to cause an elevation in LDL above the th percentile in the general population 
Increased rate of formation of LDL  defective clearance of LDL  or both could be responsible for this elevation 
Recent evidence suggests that this may result from a reduced activity of hepatic LDL receptors 
Clinical distinction between this disorder and familial hypercholesterolemia and familial combined hyperlipidemia is mainly obtained by family studies and examination for tendon xanthomas 
Hyperlipidemia occurs in only  of the first degree relatives in the polygenic disorder  while it occurs in around  of the relatives in the other two conditions 
Tendon xanthomas are not found in both the polygenic disorder and familial combined hyperlipidemia but occur in around  of adult heterozygotes with familial hypercholesterolemia 
Epidemiologic studies indicate that subjects with this disorder are at particularly high risk for coronary artery disease 
Familial hypercholesterolemia is a common autosomal dominant disorder that affects approximately   persons in the general population 
Its principal defect lies in the gene for the LDL receptor on the surface of cells so that clearance of LDL from plasma is delayed 
Homozygotes are rare and usually attain a six  to eightfold increase in total plasma cholesterol due to an elevation in LDL  heterozygotes may have a two  to threefold elevation and can be diagnosed at birth with analysis of umbilical cord blood 
The most important clinical characteristic of this disorder is the presence of premature and accelerated coronary artery disease 
Heterozygotes manifest myocardial infarctions around the third decade  while homozygotes usually die of myocardial infarction complications before age 
The second most important finding is the presence of xanthomas over tendons 
Although tendon xanthomas are virtually diagnostic of the condition  their absence does not exclude it 
Other associated findings include xanthelasmas and arcus corneae 
Familial hypercholesterolemia can be diagnosed in sophisticated laboratories by direct measurement of the number of LDL receptors on freshly isolated lymphocytes or on cultured skin fibroblasts 
It has been diagnosed in utero by the absence of LDL receptors on cultured amniotic fluid cells 
Familial combined hyperlipidemia is another common disorder that has an autosomal dominant inheritance 
It can present clinically as hypercholesterolemia type a  hypertriglyceridemia type  or both type b and has also been called multiple type hyperlipoproteinemia 
It is characterized clinically by the absence of hyperlipoproteinemia during childhood  and its development occurs around puberty in association with variable and mild elevation in plasma lipid levels 
There is no specific clinical or laboratory test to determine if an individual has this disorder  and family screening is needed in order to make the diagnosis 
Nevertheless  it should be suspected in any individual with a mild hyperlipoproteinemia whose lipoprotein type changes with time 
This condition is also characterized by an increased incidence of premature atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction 
The basic abnormality apparently is overproduction of lipoproteins that contain apolipoprotein B apo B 
Various common disorders are associated with hypercholesterolemia 
Among these are hypothyroidism  nephrotic syndrome  dysproteinemias  obstructive liver disease  and use of thiazide diuretics 
The primary disorders predominantly causing hypertriglyceridemia are   familial hypertriglyceridemia   familial combined hyperlipidemia   congenital deficiency of lipoprotein lipase   deficiency of apoprotein CII and  familial dysbetalipoproteinemias 
Familial hypertriglyceridemia is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by increased plasma concentration of VLDL type  lipoprotein pattern 
Moderate elevations of triglycerides usually occur during early adulthood  and a triad of obesity  hyperglycemia  and hyperinsulinemia can be seen in affected individuals 
In individuals with moderate elevation in plasma triglycerides associated with a normal cholesterol level  the possibility of familial hypertriglyceridemia should be suspected 
Although patients with this disorder usually have moderate elevation of plasma triglycerides  whenever conditions known to elevate this lipid fraction  such as diabetes mellitus or alcohol or oral contraceptive consumption  concurrently occur  they may develop a profound hypertriglyceridemia and a mixed hyperlipidemia type  lipoprotein pattern 
An increased incidence of atherosclerosis has been reported 
Hypertension and hyperuricemia have also been frequently observed 
Familial combined hyperlipidemia has already been discussed under Hypercholesterolemia 
Congenital lipoprotein lipase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder secondary to absence or severe diminution in the activity of lipoprotein lipase 
Affected individuals are homozygous for a mutation that prevents normal expression of lipoprotein lipase activity 
The parents  although clinically normal  are obligate heterozygotes 
This enzymatic disorder is reflected in a massive accumulation of chylomicrons in the plasma without elevation of VLDL type  lipoprotein pattern 
Triglycerides may reach levels of  to   mgdl 
This disorder usually appears in childhood with recurrent bouts of abdominal pain secondary to pancreatitis 
Another characteristic feature of the disorder is the occurrence of eruptive xanthomas  predominantly in the buttocks and other pressure sensitive areas of the body  attributed to the deposition of chylomicron triglycerides in histiocytes 
The elevation in chylomicrons may also cause a lipemic serum  a picture of lipemia retinalis  and hepatosplenomegaly 
The diagnosis is suspected by the presence of a lipemic plasma in a young patient who has fasted for  hours 
Overnight incubation of a test tube of such plasma in a refrigeration at °C demonstrates a visible white layer at the top of the tube 
Failure of lipoprotein lipase levels to increase after an infusion of heparin confirms the diagnosis 
The occurrence of accelerated atherosclerosis is not reported in this condition 
Apoprotein CII deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by absence of apoprotein CII  a required co factor for the activity of lipoprotein lipase 
The ensuing functional deficiency in this enzyme leads to a clinical picture similar to that described above for congenital lipoprotein lipase deficiency 
However  in contrast to what occurs in the latter disorder  affected individuals are diagnosed at later age and rarely present eruptive xanthomas 
The usual presentation is also with recurrent abdominal pains secondary to acute pancreatitis 
At times the diagnosis is made by chance discovery of a milky serum 
Due to the inherent defect in this condition  in which lipoprotein lipase is not activated  both chylomicrons and VLDL are elevated in the blood causing a type  or type  lipoprotein pattern 
Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia  also called familial type  hyperlipoproteinemia  is a condition inherited through a single gene mechanism whose clinical presentation requires the presence of other genetic or environmental factors 
Elevation of both plasma cholesterol and triglycerides occurs because of accumulation of remnant VLDL particles in the plasma 
The metabolic defect in most patients occurs in apolipoprotein E 
This has three common alleles  designated E  E  and E 
Patients with this disorder have only apolipoprotein E in VLDL  which is less effective in facilitating clearance of remnants than E or E 
The condition occurs only in individuals who are homozygous for E  that is  those with an EE genotype 
Clinical evidence of hyperlipoproteinemia usually appears after the second decade 
The characteristic clinical findings are xanthoma striata palmaris and tuberous and tuberoeruptive xanthomas over the elbows and knees 
The disorder is associated with severe atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries  abdominal aorta  and peripheral arteries 
The diagnosis is facilitated by encountering a broad beta band on lipoprotein electrophoresis 
Confirmation can be obtained in specialized laboratories either by measuring the chemical composition of the VLDL fraction after ultracentrifugation of the plasma or by determining for the E allele after isoelectric focusing of remnant proteins 
A variety of disorders Table 
may cause a secondary hypertriglyceridemic state by several mechanisms 
The most common of these disorders are non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus  excessive alcohol consumption  and intake of oral contraceptives 
Another clinical condition associated with elevation in plasma lipoproteins is hyperalphalipoproteinemia  characterized by elevated plasma levels of high density lipoproteins 
The elevation in HDL leads to slight increase in total plasm cholesterol values 
Other plasma lipid components LDL  VLDL  and triglycerides are normal 
The majority of cases of hyperalphalipoproteinemia are genetic with either a dominant or polygenic inheritance 
Secondary elevations of HDL have been related to various factors such as weight reduction  regular exercise  moderate alcohol intake  estrogen administration  exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides  and biliary cirrhosis 
Patients with this condition usually do not present any distinguishing clinical features 
As previously mentioned  hyperalphalipoproteinemia is associated with a decreased risk of coronary atherosclerosis and with increased longevity 
Hypoalphalipoproteinemia probably is the most clinically significant hypolipoproteinemia in view of the fact that considerable evidence suggests that low levels of plasma HDL cholesterol are related to an increased incidence of coronary heart disease in high risk populations 
According to the NIH Consensus Conference  the finding of HDL cholesterol values below  mgdl constitutes an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease 
Several factors have been identified as causing a decrease in HDL cholesterol 
These include ill defined genetic factors  obesity  cigarette smoking  physical inactivity  hypertriglyceridemia  oral contraceptives  beta adrenergic blocking drugs  thiazide diuretics  and cholesterol reducing diets 
Other hypolipoproteinemias comprise two rare disorders characterized by a decrease in the concentration of lipids in plasma and an autosomal recessive inheritance 
Abetalipoproteinernia usually appears early in childhood  and because of a defective production of apoprotein B  there is absence of chylomicrons  VLDL  and LDL in the plasma 
The plasma cholesterol level is usually less than  mgdl and that of triglycerides less than  mgdl 
The main clinical features are malabsorption of fats  peripheral neuropathy  ataxia  retinitis pigmentosa  and acanthocytosis 
Tangier disease is a condition that also manifests in childhood and is characterized by the absence of HDL from the plasma 
This defect leads to the production of abnormal chylomicron remnants  which are stored as cholesterol esters in cells of the phagocytic system 
Levels of plasma cholesterol are usually less than  mgdl and that of triglycerides range from  to  mgdl 
The main clinical features are enlarged orange tonsils  corneal opacities  and infiltration of the bone marrow and the intestinal mucosa 
Patients with this illness are at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis 
Dyslipoproteinemia  is the term utilized for conditions in which structurally abnormal lipoproteins circulate in plasma 
Such a defect is seen in lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase LCAT deficiency 
This is a rare disorder in which decreased activity of this enzyme leads to a large accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in plasma and body tissues 
Laboratory findings include a variable level of total plasma cholesterol with decreased esterified cholesterol  an increase in unesterified cholesterol and increased VLDL 
The structure of all the lipoproteins is abnormal 
The condition usually presents in young adulthood with corneal opacities  renal insufficiency  hemolytic anemia  and premature atherosclerosis
