Cerebrospinal fluid CSF is a biologic fluid  formed mainly in the ventricular choroid plexus  distributed within the ventricular system  basal cisterns  and subarachnoid space 
Analysis of the CSF provides invaluable diagnostic information because diseases take place either within its bounding membranes e g   meningitis or in the adjoining parameningeal structures of the brain e g   brain abscess 
Table 
lists normal lumbar CSF values for adults 
A detailed discussion of normal values and the factors affecting them can be found in Fishman 
==========
There are multiple indications for performing a lumbar puncture 
Examination of the CSF is useful in patients suspected of having meningitis  encephalitis  neurosyphilis  subarachnoid hemorrhage  multiple sclerosis  Guillain Barré syndrome  meningeal carcinomatosis  and many other processes that may involve the CNS 
Lumbar punctures are often performed on patients with unexplained seizures  fever of unknown origin  dementia  and acute confusional states 
CSF examination is performed as follow up in various meningitides and as a preface to instituting anticoagulant therapy 
Therapeutically the technique is used in the treatment of certain diseases  and diagnostically for the introduction of contrast material 
This list is incomplete and does not address complex issues related to if and when to perform the test in the various conditions listed above 
Contraindications must be considered with care before performing the lumbar puncture 
The procedure is absolutely contraindicated when there is infection in the skin overlying the access site because of the likelihood of producing purulent meningitis 
Papilledema is a relative contraindication 
When the papilledema is caused by pseudotumor cerebri  lumbar puncture is not contraindicated and may be used as part of the therapy 
Papilledema caused by an intracranial mass lesion is another matter 
Mass lesions cause distortion and obstruction of the ventricular system 
Interference with intracranial pressure dynamics  in the face of such displacement  can result in the production of or exacerbation of tentorial or cerebellar pressure cones  leading to death due to brainstem compression 
Deterioration can be immediate  or occur within  hours Duffy 
The availability of computed tomography CT has solved to a large degree the dilemma previously faced by clinicians seeing a patient with papilledema in whom the diagnosis was obscure 
A lumbar puncture can be performed with some degree of safety in the presence of papilledema when a CT scan demonstrates there is no obstruction or displacement of the ventricular system and no evidence of a mass lesion 
A bleeding diathesis is a relative contraindication to lumbar puncture 
A platelet count of   or lower greatly increases the possibility of a spinal epidural hematoma occurring after the procedure 
The platelet count  prothrombin  and partial thromboplastin times should be evaluated in susceptible patients 
Appropriate replacement therapy should be instituted and maintained a suitable time in the event of abnormalities 
These statements also apply to patients who are anticoagulated for therapeutic reasons 
Another relative contraindication is severe pulmonary disease or respiratory difficulty in the patient 
The optimum position of the patient significantly decreases pulmonary function 
Lumbar puncture should be approached with great caution in the hypoxic patient 
Appropriate respiratory support measures should be undertaken before the procedure 
An assistant should monitor respiratory function at every moment while the spinal tap is being performed 
Performance of the lumbar puncture begins with carefully explaining to the patient andor the family the indications  complications  and technique of the procedure 
Many patients have an ingrained fear of lumbar puncture  based on anecdotal accounts of various mishaps 
Fear of paralysis ranks high on the list of patient concerns 
A painstaking explanation of the procedure couched in language understandable to the particular patient will usually alleviate this and other anxieties 
The technique is simple  but success often eludes the operator who is not meticulous about the position of the patient and the needle 
Three essential features must be observed 
  The patient must be precisely horizontal 
 The back of the patient must be exactly perpendicular to the bed or table 
 The needle must be inserted in the exact midline parallel to the horizontal plane 
Conscientious adherence to these points will usually mean an effortless and virtually painless procedure 
The patient is positioned on a hard surface bed or table on his or her side  with the craniospinal axis parallel to the floor 
Any elevation of the head above the level of the spinal needle may falsely elevate the CSF pressure 
An assistant is helpful in maintaining the neck and thighs acutely flexed and at the same time keeping the back in the vertical plane 
The greater the degree of flexion  the greater the likelihood of successbut bear in mind the cautions above with respect to hypoxic patients 
The operator should check the position of the patient with respect to the horizontal  and the perpendicularity of the back to the horizontal plane after positioning 
The importance of this cannot be too strongly emphasized 
Sterile technique is mandatory 
After the area has been prepared  local anesthesia should be used 
A small bleb should be made in the exact midline  precisely where the spinal needle will be inserted 
It is not necessary to infiltrate deeper than the subcutaneous tissues 
If the spinal needle is in the exact midline plane  there will be no pain 
The occurrence of pain after the skin has been penetrated immediately alerts the clinician to the fact that the spinal needle is not properly positioned 
The optimal entry site is the midline of the L  interspace crossed by a line connecting the tops of both iliac crests 
The two lower spaces are also usable 
A  or  gauge needle is recommended 
A stylet is necessary 
Epidermoid tumors are occasionally present in the midline 
The stylet prevents the implantation of these tumor cells into the subarachnoid space 
The bevel of the needle is pointed upward toward the ceiling in the horizontal patient so that the point slips in between the fibers of the dura  leaving the smallest possible hole 
The midline is the necessary entry site 
This site avoids the nerve roots  which are fixed laterally as they exit the spinal canal 
The importance of lining the needle up at an exact right angle to the patient's body has been emphasized above 
As soon as the needle penetrates the skin  the hub is aimed at the umbilicus 
Any pain on the part of the patient is an indication that the needle is not in the exact midline  which is where it should be for a successful procedure 
If there is pain  reassess the position of the needle  withdrawing into the subcutaneous tissue in order to redirect it  if necessary 
Slowly advance the needle till a snap or give is felt at approximately  to  cm depth 
This sensation is created by penetration of the ligamentum flavum 
The stylus is withdrawn 
If no CSF is obtained  rotate the needle  degrees 
If this is unsuccessful  withdraw the needle to the subcutaneous plane and realign it 
As soon as CSF appears in the hub  the three way stopcock is inserted and the CSF manometer is attached rapidly  in order to avoid significant fluid loss that can falsely lower the CSF pressure 
The CSF should rise and fall in a gentle rhythm if the needle is correctly placed 
There are two rhythms to the oscillations  a  to  mm variation with heartbeat  and a  to  mm variation with respiration 
If there is any question about the free flow of the fluid  have the assistant gently but firmly compress the patient's abdomen 
The pressure should immediately rise  to  mm due to increased pressure in the venous system and then rapidly fall as the abdominal pressure is released 
If it appears there is partial obstruction to fluid flow  gingerly rotate the needle and see if there is free flow a nerve fiber may be blocking the aperture 
If this maneuver is unsuccessful  then tinker gently with the position of the needle 
Note the opening pressure 
If it is above normal  several maneuvers should be performed to make sure the pressure is not falsely elevated 
The usual cause of a falsely elevated pressure is abdominal compression  with a resulting elevation of venous pressure  due either to position or anxiety with a consequent tensing of the abdominal musculature 
Have the assistant gently straighten the legs 
In most cases the pressure will decrease to normal 
If this does not work  give the patient a distracting taskenumerate the months of the year  names of children  etc 
Most false elevations of pressure will be taken care of with these stratagems 
The record of every lumbar puncture with an elevated pressure should contain the notation of the procedures performed to ascertain the correctness of the pressure 
If the opening pressure is felt to be truly greater than  mm  then only  ml of CSF should be removed  and the procedure terminated 
This is a prudent measure  even though the hydrodynamic changes that cause herniation in the face of elevated pressure are due to CSF leakage through the dural rent created by the needle and not to the amount removed for laboratory examination 
The leakage can continue for many hours 
The patient should be placed in an intensive care unit and observed closely for signs of herniation for the next  hours 
A CT scan of the head should be done immediately if one was not done prior to the lumbar puncture 
Hyperventilation and mannitol therapy should be instituted if appropriate 
Ten to  ml of fluid may be removed from the adult patient and apportioned into tubes as outlined in Figure 
The closing pressure reading should be recorded  as the drop from the opening pressure can give a rough estimate of pressure volume relationships 
There are several other techniques for obtaining CSF that can be done in special situations 
These include a lateral cervical puncture  cisternal puncture  and lateral lumbar puncture Fishman 
The complications of lumbar puncture are relatively few in number  albeit either unpleasant andor dangerous 
Brain herniation is the most serious complication 
Both uncal and cerebellar herniation may occur 
The incidence in the literature is variously reported at  to  Fishman 
The mechanism appears to be a rostrocaudal displacement of the brain in the face of a partial obstruction to CSF flow that existed prior to the lumbar puncture 
Therapeutic maneuvers have been discussed above 
Headache after the tap is the most common complication 
Tourtellotte and associates  reported an extensive review of the literature 
The incidence after spinal anesthesia is around 
The onset occurs in  minutes to  days after the procedure  usually lasting  to  days 
They are usually frontal often retro orbital and are described as pounding 
The headache occurs whenever the patient sits or stands  and disappears with recumbency 
The use of small gauge needles in performing the procedure has greatly lessened the occurrence of headaches 
In severe cases a spinal epidural patch with the patient's own blood is highly effective in relieving the headache 
Studies relating immobility in bed after the procedure to occurrence of postspinal headache have been contradictory 
Diplopia due to unilateral or bilateral sixth nerve palsy occurs in a small percentage of patients 
The lowered CSF pressure causes the sixth nerve to stretch as it courses over the petrous bone 
The diplopia is usually transient  although on rare occasions it may be permanent 
A patch is useful for a few days 
If the injury is permanent  then consultation with an ophthalmologist is necessary  as certain measures such as application of botulinum toxin can be quite helpful 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage  or a traumatic tap  is common 
The needle penetrates some of the small equina vessels  causing the hemorrhage 
Xanthochromic spinal fluid  a fever  and stiff neck may ensue later  mimicking a spontaneous subarachnoid bleed 
A spinal epidural hematoma or spinal subdural hematoma may occur due to nicking of the spinal radicular arteries 
Other and more rare complications are discussed in Fishman 
Examination of the CSF begins immediately after collection of the specimen 
The fluid is observed for turbidity  normal fluid is clear 
The color of the fluid is noted next 
This must be done within  minutes of collection of the fluid  since red cell lysis after this time can affect the results 
This is a vital piece of information that often provides the sole objective clue to the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage 
Take a glass tube of the CSF and prepare an identical test tube filled with the same amount of water 
Look down the long axes of the tubes against a white background 
If any difference is perceived between the two tubes  then there is an abnormal pigment in the CSF specimen 
Xanthochromia is the usual abnormal color 
Diagnostic considerations that apply to xanthochromia are given below 
A gram stain  AFB acid fast bacillus stain for tuberculosis  and India ink examination should be done promptly on the CSF 
The gram stain has the virtue of providing an instant  almost exact etiologic diagnosis in bacterial meningitis  thus permitting much needed specific therapy  in  to  of cases of bacterial meningitis 
For undetermined reasons  the yield in Listeria monocytogenes meningitis is much lower 
False positive results have been reported on rare occasions Musher and Schell 
The yield of the gram stain may be improved by use of the cytospin slide centrifuge Peterson et al 
The India ink examination has the charm of an immediate  specific diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis within minutes of obtaining CSF 
Unfortunately it is positive in only  of cases of cryptococcal meningitis up to  in AIDS patients 
Be sure to use well filtered India ink in order to avoid false positive results 
Another source of false positive results is misinterpretation of small mononuclear cells as yeasts 
This can be avoided by the experienced observer by noting the highly refractile cell wall and internal structure of the cryptococci not seen in lymphocytes and the fact that the interface between the ink and the cells is blurred when they are leukocytes 
To be more specific  only budding yeast cells seen on India ink examination shall be considered cryptococci 
Sensitivity of the AFB stain has varied widely in different reported series  ranging from  to as high as 
The latter yield was reported by Stewart  with the stacking method  After centrifuging  to  ml of CSF at  rpm min all but a few drops are removed 
Then a thick smear containing the whole of the pellet is stained and the slide examined for  to  minutes 
Newer approaches such as adenosine deaminase and tuberculostearic acid are being developed  since the diagnosis of tuberculosis meningitis is difficult 
Only time will tell 
The tubes are sent for laboratory examination according to the schema outlined in Figure 
Examination of the fluid for white cells and red cells must be done within  hour of collection  before the cells have been lysed 
A procedure note should be written in the chart after the lumbar puncture is completed 
This note should contain the following information 
  Indications for procedure  Complications if any  Technique  Condition of patient after procedure  Opening pressure with statement about dynamics  Closing pressure  Turbidity  Color  state colorless if this is the case  Laboratory values available when note written as well as a list of tests ordered  Analysis of information obtained 
Further laboratory information and analyses should be entered as they are obtained 
It is of some benefit to save in the refrigerator at °C an extra tube of CSF to be analyzed if further tests are indicated after the initial evaluation 
==========
There are a number of excellent reviews of the basic science of the CSF Fishman    Cutler and Spertell    McComb    Davson 
CSF is secreted by the choroid plexus at the rate of about  ml per day 
ml per minute  and a turnover of  per hour 
The usual volume is  ml 
Formation occurs as a result of a two step process 
Fluid is first filtered through the core capillaries of the choroid plexus into the extracellular space surrounding the choroidal cells 
This fluid is a plasma ultrafiltrate 
Then sodium is actively transported by sodium potassium activated adenosine triphosphatase ATPase across the choroidal cells into the CSF  water follows down an osmotic  gradient 
Cholinergic stimulation increases production and adrenergic stimulation decreases production 
Drugs that inhibit sodium potassium ATPase or carbonic anhydrase decrease production 
Furosemide also slows CSF production due to its effect on chloride flux 
Some CSF is apparently produced in the ependyma of the brain  in addition to the choroid plexus 
The arachnoid granulations  which penetrate the major dural venous sinuses  constitute the major resorptive sites 
They are also present in the epidural veins around the spinal nerve roots  whether or not CSF is absorbed at these sites is unknown 
These structures are herniations of the arachnoid membrane 
CSF is absorbed in bulk through the arachnoid villi by mechanisms that are incompletely understood 
It has recently been proposed that multiple vacuoles in I he arachnoid villous membrane allow the vesicular transport of CSF in bulk 
In addition to the bulk resorption  many solutes are actively transported by the choroid plexus and other cells  such as capillary endothelial cells 
Finally  solutes can disappear by diffusion into the brain and brain capillaries 
The brain is protected from macrormolecules by the blood brain barrier 
The morphologic barrier is provided by endothelial tight junctions 
Several areas of the brain  however  have windows or sections that do not have tight junctions  portions of the hypothalamus  the area postrema  the subfornical and subcommissural organs Fishman 
In these areas the plasma has closer proximity to osmoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the brain 
The molecular weight of solutes greatly influences their admission into the CSF 
Other solute properties that are important include lipid solubility  ionization  and protein binding 
Certain solutes are actively transported by specific systems in brain endothelial cells 
==========
Analysis of the CSF provides invaluable insight into pathologic derangements of the nervous system 
The sequence of the discussion follows the usual order of examination of the CSF 
The usual range of opening pressure in the literature is  to  mm CSF 
Generally pressures over  are considered to be abnormal 
The causes of intracranial hypertension are manifold  ranging from pseudotumor cerebri to intracranial neoplasms 
Meningitis  subarachnoid hemorrhage  elevated central venous pressure and a host of other conditions elevate CSF pressure 
A reason must be found in every case 
Table 
presents a highly useful classification of various causes of brain edema 
Comparison of the opening and closing pressures provides a crude estimation of the volume of the CSF reservoir 
A large fall in pressure indicates a very small reservoir e g   opening pressure  mm  closing pressure after removal of  ml  zero  while very little change after removal of a large amount of fluid indicates a large reservoir 
This observation was of greater value when techniques such as CT scanning and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging were not available 
The normal CSF is crystal clear 
The occurrence of pleocytosis is the usual reason for cloudy fluid 
At least  white cells per cubic millimeter can be present without altering the clarity 
Over  white cells per cubic millimeter usually produces cloudiness 
Red cell concentrations between  and  per cubic millimeter can cause the fluid to appear cloudy  while concentrations of over  give a grossly bloody appearance 
A markedly elevated protein can also alter the clarity of the CSF 
The clarity of the fluid is of little clinical use  except to provide an immediate indication of abnormality of the CSF 
A very useful point to remember is that a large number of cells can be present without affecting the clarity 
The presence or absence of color  usually xanthochromia  in the CSF is a crucial observation 
Xanthochromia commonly indicates spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage 
A variety of conditions  however  can also produce xanthochromia  a traumatic tap  bilirubin due to jaundice  protein  etc 
Table 
summarizes factors which need to be considered in the analysis of xanthochromia 
Analysis of the cellular components of the CSF is the single most valuable indicator of infectious diseases of the nervous system 
Infections of the nervous system produce what Shulman and Schlossberg  have described as three basic CSF types 
Using these types as a guide  the clinician can come up with a list of the most likely diagnoses 
Clinical information and other tests can help to identify the specific diagnosis 
Tables 
through 
summarize this information 
The discussion that follows is anchored to these tables 
Type A fluid is characterized by  to   WBC   of which are polymorphonuclear leukocytes  low CSF sugar  and protein elevated to  to  mgdl 
Bacterial meningitis is the most common cause of this CSF formula 
A gram stain of the CSF sediment will reveal the causative organism in up to  of cases 
An exception is Listeria monocytogenes  which will have a positive gram stain in only  of cases 
In those cases where the gram stain is non revealing  the patient's age and the clinical and epidemiologic setting may offer clues to the etiologic agent 
Partially treated bacterial meningitis Dalton and Allison   on rare occasions  will have type C fluid characteristics due to incomplete treatment with empirical antibiotics 
Most such CSF specimens will retain type A characteristics  with some decrease in sensitivity of gram stain by  and culture by  as compared to untreated patients 
Also noteworthy is the fact that gram positive organisms tend to appear as gram negative after exposure to antibiotics 
The mean CSF pleocytosis  protein  and glucose level are not significantly affected by prior empirical therapy 
Multiple factors play a role in the effect of prior antibiotic  therapy on the identification of the etiologic agent  such as sensitivity of the organism to the empirically administered antibiotic and CSF penetration of the antimicrobial that has been used 
Acute bacterial meningitis will on rare occasions produce minimal or even absent CSF abnormalities 
This so called normocellular or developing bacterial meningitis occurs most commonly in immunosuppressed patients 
It is fortunately quite uncommon 
There are a number of tests that may be valuable aids in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis 
An excellent review on the clinical relevance of rapid diagnostic techniques for detection of bacterial polysaccharide antigens has been published Kejlan 
A recent paper reviews rapid but nonspecific techniques in the evaluation of bacterial meningitis  such as C reactive protein  LDH isoenzymes  gas liquid chromatography for chemotyping etiologic agents by means of analysis of lipid  carbohydrate  and lipopolysaccharide components of bacterial cells and Limulus assay Martin 
Primary amebic meningoencephalitis Duma et al    is a rare but devastating condition  caused by free living amebas 
The disease is classically associated with fresh water exposure swimming in ponds and lakes in the summer 
The organisms are thought to penetrate through the nasal mucosa  hypo osmia is frequently reported 
After a brief incubation an acute  rapidly progressive meningoencephalitis ensues 
The classic epidemiology  absence of organisms on gram stain and eventually on culture  and a hemorrhagic component to the fluid should promptly suggest the diagnosis  which can be confirmed by wet mounts of the CSF revealing motile trophozoites 
Amphotericin B therapy  both systemically and intrathecally  has occasionally met with some success 
Ruptured brain abscess is a medical catastrophe with an extremely high mortality 
The diagnosis is suggested by a gram stain showing multiple types of organisms  with tinctorial characteristics suggestive of anaerobes  an extremely high protein level  and the eventual isolation of multiple organisms  including anaerobes 
Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agent NSAIA meningitis is a peculiar and rare entity that has been described recently 
NSAIA is seen predominantly but not exclusively in patients with collagen vascular diseases Ballas and Donta 
At variable intervals after initial exposure to a different NSAIA  patients develop a clinical picture compatible with acute meningitis 
CSF examination shows pleocytosis as high as  WBCmm white blood cells per cubic millimeter with marked predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMLs as high as   variable protein elevation as high as  mgdl  and minimal or no drop in glucose 
This is obviously a diagnosis of exclusion 
Most patients need empiric antibiotic coverage for acute bacterial meningitis until the diagnosis is established in retrospect 
Other drugs that have been associated with neutrophilic pleocytosis include sulfonamides and isoniazid 
Chronic neutrophilic meningitis Peacock et al     albeit rare  may become more common as the number of chronically immunosuppressed hosts increases 
Type B fluid is characterized by  to  WBC that are mononuclear cells but may be PMLs early in the course of the disease  a low or occasionally normal CSF sugar  and a protein of  to  mgdl 
This fluid is characteristic of tuberculosis and other granulomatous meningitides 
Tuberculous meningitis Molavi and LeFrock   usually has an insidious presentation  it can present more acutely  usually in children 
Although the hallmark is a mononuclear pleocytosis  the CSF on occasion will have an early PMN predominance 
If this is the case  there will be a gradual shift to mononuclear cells over  to  days 
Fungal meningitis can be produced by a variety of fungal agents  the most frequent of which are cryptococci  histoplasma  coccidioides  and Candida 
Usually seen in immunosuppressed individuals andor in highly endemic areas in the Ohio valley for histoplasma  southwestern U S 
for coccidioides  they present acutely or in an indolent fashion 
In the case of cryptococcal meningitis  an India ink preparation will show the characteristically encapsulated yeasts in  of patients Figure 
A number of serological tests can aid in the diagnosis of certain of these causes of meningitis 
The serological test for cryptococcal antigen detection is remarkably accurate 
It has a sensitivity of  when compared to the gold standard  isolation of the fungi  and high specificity when the possible interference by rheumatoid factor is addressed by appropriate absorption steps 
The cryptococcal antigen titer is reported to be of prognostic value and sequential antigen levels are frequently used in evaluation of therapeutic response Diamond and Bennett 
The antigen test has the advantage of speed as opposed to a culture that may take weeks to become positive 
Histoplasma and coccidioides CSF serology is also quite useful Plouffe and Fass 
Sarcoidosis Delaney   often has meningeal involvement 
The characteristic picture is a mild to moderate pleocytosis that is almost mononuclear  in the range of  to  WBCmm  mild to moderate protein elevation between  and  mgdl  and hypoglycorrhachia seen in  of patients 
This latter abnormality is seen more commonly with diffuse involvement of the meninges  hence patients with sarcoid involvement restricted to the hypothalamus are more likely to have a normal CSF 
Meningeal carcinomatosis Dyken   may be an elusive diagnosis  even in the setting of a patient with a known primary malignancy 
The crux of the diagnosis is the demonstration of neoplastic cells in the cerebrospinal fluid 
The development of improved cytologic techniques has facilitated antemortem diagnosis 
The most common primary tumors reported to cause meningeal carcinomatosis are breast carcinoma  lymphomas  lung carcinoma  and pancreatic carcinoma Olson et al 
The CSF opening pressure is usually elevated  although it can be normal early in the course of meningeal involvement 
An abnormally low opening pressure should bring to mind the possibility of a complete spinal block  which can occur late in meningeal carcinomatosis 
The CSF protein is variably elevated 
Hypoglycorrhachia  the mechanism of which is not clear  is observed in the majority of cases 
Type C fluid is characterized by  to  WBCmm  a mononuclear pleocytosis may be PMLs early  normal glucose rarely quite low  and a protein less than  mgdl 
A heterogeneous group of disorders can produce this CSF formula 
Parameningeal infections comprise an important group of diseases that need to be kept high in the differential diagnosis  otherwise they may go undetected 
The CSF is but an initial stepping stone to their detection 
Analysis of the fluid does not make the diagnosis  but begets the specific diagnostic procedure i e   sinusspineskull films  CAT of the head  etc 
The differential diagnosis of parameningeal infection includes brain abscess  subdural abscess  cerebral epidural abscess  cerebral thrombophlebitis  spinal epidural abscess  otitis  sinusitis  retropharyngeal abscess  and others 
A paramount point to remember in parameningeal infections is that the lumbar puncture is not only nondiagnostic but fraught with complications in patients with the classic parameningeal infection  a brain abscess 
Listeria monocytogenes meningitis Niedman   in a significant minority of cases about  will present with a type C CSF 
This peculiar gram positive rod with characteristic tumbling motility exhibits a marked neurotropism 
Up to  of cases of listeriosis in adults reported to the Centers for Disease Control in  had meningitis 
The organism has a propensity to afflict those at the extremes of life and immunosuppressed hosts  particularly renal transplant recipients 
However  in the review cited  consisting of  cases   occurred in apparently healthy individuals 
Syphilis remains a major health problem 
The lumbar puncture is often necessary in order to make the diagnosis and guide therapy 
Secondary syphilis that is clinically apparent has CNS involvement in  of cases  usually mimicking the syndrome of aseptic meningitis 
Other clinical presentations include transverse myelitis  cranial nerve palsies  papilledema  thrombosis of cerebral arteries  perceptive deafness  and iritis 
However  between  and  of patients with secondary syphilis and no CNS symptomatology will have an abnormal CSF as manifested by pleocytosis or elevated protein levels 
Five percent will have positive CSF serology asymptomatic secondary neurosyphilis 
In spite of these figures  some experts believe CSF examination in individuals with secondary syphilis and no CNS symptomatology is not necessary  as adequate treatment of secondary lues benzathine penicillin G 
million units IM ×  prevents progression to classic tertiary stage neurosyphilis 
In this context  the main value of doing a diagnostic LP in the rare patient with symptomatic neurologic disease is to exclude other causes of the picture of aseptic meningitis 
There may also be real value in doing follow up examination of the CSF 
Tertiary classic neurosyphilis spans a wide spectrum of clinical presentations  artificially divided into four syndromes  asymptomatic  meningovascular  parenchymatous dementia paralytica or general paresis  and tabes dorsalis 
Asymptomatic neurosyphilis by definition consists of an abnormal CSF in the absence of clinical CNS involvement 
Abnormalities of the CSF consist of lymphocytic pleocytosis < cellsmm  normal or slightly elevated protein < mgdl  and positive nontreponemal test in over  of cases 
In the pre penicillin era  asymptomatic neurosyphilis was reported to progress to clinical neurosyphilis in  to  of cases 
Meningovascular neurosyphilis is defined as ischemic injury to any part of the CNS due to syphilitic endarteritis 
It constitutes approximately  of cases of neurosyphilis  occurring  to  years after acquisition of the infection 
Untreated  it may progress to parenchymatous disease 
The CSF reveals mild  to  cellsmm lymphocytic pleocytosis  protein in the range of  to  mgdl  and a positive VDRL 
Parenchymatous neurosyphilis  or general paresis  is syphilitic meningoencephalitis 
It has an incubation period of  to  years and is a composite of neurologic and psychiatric manifestations that span the gamut 
Of note  seizures seen in up to  of cases may be the presenting manifestation 
The CSF shows essentially the same characteristics as described for the meningovascular type 
Tabes dorsalis is currently the most uncommon form of neurosyphilis 
In the pre penicillin era it accounted for one third of cases 
Its incubation period is in the range of  to  years 
Lightning pains  visceral crises  broad based stamping gait  optic atrophy  Charcot joints  and pupillary abnormalities are the salient features of this syndrome  reflecting syphilitic damage to posterior roots and posterior column dysfunction 
The cell count may be normal in up to  of cases and the CSF VDRL nonreactive in a third of patients 
In the evaluation of patients suspected of having neurosyphilis it is well to remember the insensitivity nonreactive in  and nonspecificity of the blood nontreponemal tests 
Ten percent of individuals over  years old have a biologic false positive nontreponemal test 
These patients are the ones usually being worked up for dementia 
Such patients should have a treponemal test done with or without a nontreponemal test 
The FTA Abs test is not recommended in the CSF as it is extremely sensitive 
Consequently  minimal contamination of the CSF with FTA Abs positive blood  at concentrations not detectable by the naked eye  will give false positive results 
Unfortunately  since the CSF nontreponemal test may be falsely negative  there is no study in the literature that investigates the specificity of a CSF FTA test when there is absolutely no contamination as ascertained by no RBC in the CSF fluid 
Rocky Mountain spotted fever RMSF may cause type C CSF 
A stiff neck in patients with RMSF may be due to meningitis or to myalgias of the cervical musculature 
In a series from North Carolina Kaplowitz et al     CSF pleocytosis was present in   with WBC  mm in  out of  patients 
A PMN predominance was seen in  of cases including all those CSF with WBC > mm 
Modest depression of CSF glucose was present in  out of    of these  patients died 
Protein ranging from  to  mgdl was present in  out of 
When severe  RMSF may resemble meningococcemia 
Toxoplasmosis Luft and Remington   of the CNS can produce different syndromes  depending on the host 
In immunocompetent individuals CNS involvement is rare  presenting as part of a syndrome of diffuse and uncontrolled dissemination or as active infection limited to the CNS 
In immunosuppressed hosts lymphoproliferative neoplasms  organ transplant recipients  AIDS and miscellaneous immunosuppressive states such as collagen vascular diseases and hemochromatosis  toxoplasma can produce a severe necrotizing encephalitis 
The third clinical setting is that of congenital toxoplasmosis 
The CSF routine examination cells  protein  and glucose is that of type C fluid without specific diagnostic features 
Approaches to a specific diagnosis isolation of the organism by mouse inoculation  immunofluorescent staining of spun CSF  toxoplasma antibody titers in CSF have met with insensitivity and nonspecificity problems 
The current approach is to evaluate the local production of antibodies within the CNS 
Herpes simplex I HSV I meningoencephalitis  while a rare complication of HSV I infection  is probably the most common acute nonepidemic viral encephalitis in the United States Whitley 
This observation  coupled with the availability of specific therapy  has made HSV I meningoencephalitis a very important diagnosis to confirm or exclude 
Unfortunately  the CSF offers little help in this regard 
Abnormalities are variable  a moderate pleocytosis with PMN and lymphocytes is seen 
Some authors report the presence of RBCs in most cases  as a manifestation of the necrotizing nature of the disease 
Mild elevation of protein and normal glucose levels complete the nonspecific findings 
The final diagnosis currently rests on the brain biopsy with histologic and cultural techniques 
A high index of suspicion and a vigorous and prompt diagnostic approach are required  as the earlier the diagnosis is made and therapy instituted  the better the outcome 
Viral meningitides also produce type C CSF 
The term aseptic is a misnomer  as the etiologic agents usually implicated in this syndrome are infectious agents  albeit non treatable 
Enteroviruses account for over  of cases 
Other agents that can produce the same clinical and CSF picture include flaviviruses St 
Louis encephalitis agent  mumps late winter spring  herpes simplex  lymphocytic choriomeningitis LCM  and the human immunodeficiency virus HIV 
Helpful epidemiologic clues as to the viral nature of the etiology are occurrence in the summer months and age of the patients usually < years old  but the diagnosis most of the time is one of exclusion 
Not infrequently  the initial LP shows a PMN predominance that on repeat LP within  to  hours will demonstrate a shift toward mononuclear predominance 
Hypoglycorrhachia may occur in meningitis due to mumps  herpes simplex  and herpes zoster infections 
A rash maculopapular or petechial  creating confusion and concern about meningococcemia  may be seen with Echo and Coxsackie viruses 
An etiologic diagnosis may be attempted by cultural CSF  throat  and stool swabs and serologic acute and convalescent tests 
Human immunodeficiency virus HIV  the causative agent of AIDS  can affect the CNS and thus the CSF in several ways 
  HIV may invade the CNS very early during the acute infection 
This process can be asymptomatic  can cause an aseptic meningitis or  uncommonly  an actue encephalopathy 
A mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and a normal or mildly elevated protein are seen 
HIV cultures are positive in the majority of such patients 
 After seroconversion and before overt immunosuppression  asymptomatic CSF abnormalities are not uncommon ~ 
These consist of low grade lymphocytic pleocytosis <mm and mild protein elevation 
HIV can be isolated from CSF in   of such individuals 
 Patients with ARC AIDS related complex may have bouts of acute or chronic meningitis with or without cranial neuropathies secondary to HIV which can be isolated from the CSF in the majority 
Normal to marked elevation of cells and mild elevation of proteins characterize this subset 
 Patients with AIDS overt immunosuppression can have two types of CNS diseases 
 CNS diseases directly caused by HIV AIDS dementia or a symmetric distal sensory neuropathy 
A minority of demented patients will have pleocytosis <mm 
Protein elevation can be seen in up to  of cases even in the absence of dementia or neuropathy 
CSF isolation of HIV is possible in up to two thirds of patients with AIDS  regardless of presence of dementia 
 The immunosuppression induced by HIV opens the AIDS patient to many CNS infections  mainly cryptococcal meningitis and toxoplasmosis 
Also  neurosyphilis  atypical in its course and response to therapy  seems to be associated with HIV infection 
In HIV infected individuals  the likelihood of CSF pleocytosis being related directly to HIV depends on the degree of pleocytosis cell counts >mm should bring to mind a cause other than HIV and the degree of immunosuppression  as assessed by T cell counts e g   in patients with depressed T cells  an opportunistic infection has to be strongly considered 
A problem that arises often is distinguishing between a traumatic tap superimposed on a normal CSF and a traumatic tap superimposed on a CSF that was abnormal before the tap was performed 
The question comes down to whether the WBC in the CSF are there because they are found in the blood brought into the CSF by the traumatic tap  or whether there are WBC both due to the trauma and due to an abnormal process preexisting in the CSF 
This question can be answered crudely by comparing the ratio of WBC to RBC in the peripheral blood to the ratio of WBC to RBC in the CSF 
Suppose the peripheral WBC is   with a RBC of 
The ratio is derived by dividing   by    =  WBC for every  RBC 
If the CSF has   RBC  then  WBC are allowed if the tap is traumatic 
If more than  WBC are present in the CSF  then there were preexisting WBC in the CSF 
The difficulty of sorting out a traumatic tap from a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage has been discussed above 
CSF proteins are derived from serum proteins with the exception of the trace proteins and some beta globulins 
Serum proteins enter the CSF by means of pinocytosis across the capillary endothelial cells of the brain and spinal cord 
Clinical usefulness of CSF proteins is presently limited to the measurement and characterization of total protein and IgG 
Three pathological conditions can cause abnormalities of the CSF proteins 
  Increased entry of plasma proteins due to increased permeability of the blood brain barrier 
The composition and pattern of CSF proteins will in this case reflect that of the plasma proteins  whether normal or abnormal 
 Local synthesis of proteins within the central nervous system 
Clinical interest is limited to IgG currently 
 Impaired resorption of CSF proteins by the arachnoid villi 
Elevated CSF total protein is highly suggestive of neurologic disease 
Elevation indicates increased endothelial cell permeability 
Many diseases elevate the CSF protein to some degree  as seen in Table 
Total protein over  mgdl is seen in meningitis  cord tumor with spinal block  and bloody CSF Fishman 
Each  RBCmm raises the CSF protein 
mgdl see Table 
Peripheral neuropathy due to various causes e g   diabetes is a frequent diagnosis in patients with modestly elevated total protein 
The usefulness of protein in the diagnosis of meningitis has been discussed above 
CSF that clots due to protein over  mgdl is caused by complete spinal block  usually caused by a tumor 
Froin's syndrome is the eponym 
The fluid is usually intensely xanthochromic 
IgG concentration in the CSF is normally 
± 
mgdl Fishman 
It is the principal immunoglobulin in the CSF 
Under normal conditions the CSF IgG is derived from the plasma 
Local synthesis within the central nervous system occurs in a variety of disorders  multiple sclerosis  neurosyphilis  subacute sclerosing panencephalitis  progressive rubella encephalitis  viral meningoencephalitides  sarcoidosis  etc 
The majority of these conditions are inflammatory disorders 
In addition to quantification  IgG can be characterized by agar gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing for the identification of oligoclonal banding 
Up to  of cases of confirmed multiple sclerosis have elevated gamma globulin andor oligoclonal bands 
Oligoclonal bands represent a qualitative change in IgG 
Each band is presumed to be protein derived from the response of immunocompetent cells to a single antigen 
These bands occur in the inflammatory conditions enumerated previously as causing elevated IgG 
The appearance of oligoclonal bands in the CSF in the absence of similar bands in the serum is an indication of gamma globulin production in the central nervous system even when quantified levels of gamma globulin are normal Fishman 
The difficulty in assessing IgG levels in the CSF lies in distinguishing whether elevated levels are due to increased permeability of the blood brain barrier  or whether there is local synthesis in the central nervous system 
Table 
outlines the most useful method of making this determination 
Excellent recent reviews of CSF proteins can be found in Fishman    Cutler and Spertell    Hershey and Trotter 
The usual CSF glucose is  to  of the plasma glucose 
Values under  mgdl can usually be considered abnormal  values under  mgdl are almost without exception abnormal 
Glucose enters the CSF largely through active transport 
Glucose molecules are shuttled across capillary endothelium  choroid plexus cells  neurons  and supporting cells by this mechanism Fishman 
Some glucose crosses by way of simple diffusion 
It takes about  hours for CSF glucose levels to reach equilibrium with plasma levels 
Glucose is utilized for energy by cellular elements close to the CSF  this is the principal means of glucose removal 
It also enters the venous system by way of the bulk flow of CSF 
The most common cause of lowered CSF glucose hypoglycorrhachia is meningitis  bacterial  tuberculous  fungal  amebic  acute syphilitic  chemical  and certain of the viral meningitides mumps  herpes simplex  and herpes zoster 
In acute bacterial meningitis the CSF glucose level may remain depressed for approximately  to  weeks following appropriate therapy  at a time when cells and protein levels are essentially back to normal 
Lowered CSF glucose occurs in about  of cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage  reaching a nadir  to  days after the bleed 
Meningeal carcinomatosis also produces hypoglycorrhachia 
A large variety of tumors have been implicated 
Cytologic examination of the fluid is often the key to diagnosis 
Other causes of lowered CSF glucose include sarcoidosis  cysticercosis  trichinosis  and rheumatoid meningitis Fishman
