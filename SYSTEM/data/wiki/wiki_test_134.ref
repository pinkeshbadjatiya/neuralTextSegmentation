==========
The town of Paraíso is located on the coast of Tabasco, 75 km north of the capital of Villahermosa.
Although one of its important economic activities is tourism, the center of the town has not been overwhelmed with hotels and other tourist oriented businesses.
Most of the houses of the town are modest, constructed with brick or adobe with a few hacienda style houses with lavish gardens.
The center of the town is marked by a large plaza with the San Marcos Church on the north side.
It and the La Asunción Church are the two most important as they represent its two patron saints of Mark the Evangelist and Our Lady of the Assumption.
Parque Central Guillermo Sevilla Fiqueroa features modern architecture with a tall clock tower.
It also has areas with gardens and trees and a civic plaza set up to double as an open-air theater.
There is also a cafeteria and a reflecting pool.
Carnival begins on 20 January with an event called “La Pintorrea.” On Sunday before Ash Wednesday there is a “flour war” with widows asking for alms on Ash Wednesday.
After mass the day ends with the burning of an effigy called “Juan Carnaval.”
==========
Although popular etymology has the name derived from “Paso del Paraíso” (Heaven’s Pass), in reality the name is from a type of leafy trees of the mahogany family.
The municipality does not have a coat-of-arms.
The town of Paraíso was most likely founded sometime between 1848 and 1852 as a camp by indigenous people in the Mecoacán area and then later occupied by mestizos from Jalpa de Méndez and Comalcalco.
However, local writer Ángel Suárez Rodríguez asserts that it was founded in 1823 when the ranch of the same name was declared a town.
It is true that in this year a church dedicated to Mark the Evangelist and the Virgin of the Assumption was built on the ranch.
From the 19th century on, much of the area was dedicated to the production of cacao and fruit trees.
During this same time, it was a Liberal or federalist stronghold even having its own radical guerrilla army known as “Los Cangrejos y Pejelagartos” (Crabs and Pejalagarto fish).
However, the town declined in the latter part of the century and by 1872 there were only four permanent houses.
During the Mexican Revolution, General Ignacio Gutierrez Gomez took the town in 1911.
It was taken again in 1914 by Generals Carlos Greene Ramirez and Ramon Sosa Torres.
After the war, the city grew sufficiently that in 1945 it was declared a city by Tabasco governor Noé de la Flor Casanova.

The land is part of the Tabasco floodplain on the Gulf of Mexico with an average elevation of only two meters above sea level.
It is flat with a slight incline towards the sea.
The soil is sandy with some clay mixed nearest the ocean with clay dominating inland.
Due to the its low-lying nature and climate, the area has abundant surface water in the forms of lagoons, lakes, estuaries and wetlands.
Major bodies of water include lakes and lagoons such as Mecoacán, La Machona, Tupilco, Puente de Ostión, La Encerrada (Amatillo), Tres Palmas, El Zorro, Arrastradero, Las Flores, Lagartera Tilapa, Manatí and El Eslabón.

Other rivers and streams include the Seco, El Corcho, Tupilco, Cocohital, El Corinto, Arroyo Verde and Arroyo Verde.
Surface water flow in the municipality is split into east and west, both connected by the Río Seco River and the Jobo Canal.
The east is dominated by the Mecoacán lagoon which opens into the Gulf of Mexico at Dos Bocas.
Linked to it are smaller lagoons such as the Eslabón, La Tinaja and El Carmen/Ramírez.
The Mecoacán Lagoon and estuary is a shallow area with an average depth of 1.5 meters and a total extension of 5,160 hectares.
Mecoacán is considered to be the second most important lagoon system in Tabasco with extensive oyster banks below bordered by mangrove areas which have been reduced through timber exploitation.
The seaward side is formed by a chain of small islands at the mouth of the river with the largest three km in length.
The lagoon receives fresh water from the Cuxcuxapa River and some smaller streams.
There are also two small lakes such as the Los Angeles.
The González River is the principal river on the east side, which forms the border with Centla municipality.
It forms the Estero Lagoon before emptying into the sea at the Chiltepec.
The west also has the Arrastradero Lagoon, which receives fresh water from various small streams such as El Tiger.
It connects to a smaller lagoon called Las Flores.
The Tres Palmas Lake extends to the north-south, widest in the north.
It receives water from the Soledad River.
Other lakes include Puente de Ostion, Tupilquillo and Tía Juana.

Fishing occurs in both ocean and fresh waters catching sea bass, shrimp and shellfish.
It is a major producer and distributor of oysters and lately of edible jellyfish, most of which is farmed.
However, fishing has been threatened by a number of factors.
Oil spills and red tide have led to closure of fishing areas.
In the 2000s, wild oyster yields dropped almost fifty percent in the lagoons of the Tabasco coast.
It is traditional here for men to harvest oysters and the women to process them but this economic model is disappearing.
Over exploitation of the mollusk is the main reason behind the drop in production.
A study by the Universidad Juárez Autónoma de Tabasco strongly recommends the implementation of oyster farming to replace reliance on oysters growing wild, with state authorities also pushing for this change.
However, local fishermen have been resistant to outside interference.
Just under twenty eight percent of the working population is employed in mining, petroleum, construction and manufacturing.
Oil drilling is mostly done in two fields: Puerto Ceiba Mesozoico and Puerto Ceiba Terciario, each with two wells.
These produce over two thousand barrels daily along with 1.2 million cubic feet of natural gas.
Most manufacturing is small concerns which produce corn flour, chocolate, ice, clothing, cinderblock and tortillas.
The production of fiberglass is an important source of employment.
Handcrafts include figures from dried coconuts and seashells as well as hammocks.
Oil spills both on land and in the ocean have been problematic not only for fishing but for tourism as well.
When spills happen, the smell of oil can dominate the air of the surrounding areas.
Tabasco beaches have been affected by spills that have occurred off of Campeche.
Local fishermen have expressed concerns about the viability of their livelihoods due to oil spills including those such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill off the coast of the United States.
Paraíso beaches have been closed on occasion due to high toxicity of chemical spills, which negatively affects local tourism.
In 2005, PEMEX cleaned twelve tons of pitch and other contaminants off 77 km of Tabasco beaches, including those in Paraíso.
The beaches and waters off them are monitored by federal and state authorities for toxicity and aptness for use by tourists.
