Due to her parents' occupations the family relocated to a number of places in India, including Delhi, Chandigarh, Ambala, Ladakh, Lucknow, Bareilly, and Pune.
Among the schools she attended were La Martiniere Girls' School in Lucknow and St. Maria Goretti College in Bareilly.

Among the many places that she lived, Chopra has fond memories as a child of playing in the valleys of Leh, in the cold northwestern Indian desert region of Jammu and Kashmir.
She has said, "I think I was in Class 4 when I was in Leh.
My brother was just born.
My dad was in the army and was posted there.
I stayed in Leh for a year and my memories of that place are tremendous ... We were all army kids there.
We weren't living in houses, we were in bunkers in the valley and there was a stupa right on top of a hill which used to overlook our valley.
We used to race up to the top of the stupa".
She now considers Bareilly her home town, and maintains strong connections there.
At the age of thirteen, Chopra moved to the United States to study, living with her aunt, and attending schools in Newton, Massachusetts, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, after a stop in Queens, New York, as her aunt's family also moved frequently.
While in Massachusetts, she participated in several theatre productions and studied Western classical music, choral singing and Kathak dance.
During her teenage years in America, Chopra sometimes faced racial issues and was bullied for being Indian.
She has said, "I was a gawky kid, had low self-esteem, came from a modest middle-class background, had white marks on my legs ...
But I was damn hard working.
Today, my legs sell 12 brands."
After three years, Chopra returned to India, finishing the senior year of her high-school education at the Army Public School in Bareilly.

==========
After winning Miss India World, Chopra was cast as the female lead in Abbas-Mustan's romantic thriller "Humraaz" (2002), in which she was to make her film debut.
However, this fell through for various reasons: she stated the production conflicted with her schedule, while the producers said they re-cast because Chopra took on various other commitments.
Her screen debut occurred in the 2002 Tamil film "Thamizhan" as the love interest of the protagonist, played by Vijay.
A review published in "The Hindu" was appreciative of the film for its wit and dialogue, however it felt that Chopra's role was limited from an acting viewpoint.
In 2003, Chopra made her Bollywood film debut as the second female lead opposite Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta in Anil Sharma's "".
Set against the backdrop of the Indian Army in Kashmir, the film tells the story of an agent and his fight against terrorism.
"The Hero" was one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films that year, but received mixed reviews from critics.
Derek Elley from "Variety" said that "mega-looker Chopra makes a solid screen debut."
Later that year she appeared in Raj Kanwar's box-office success "Andaaz" with Akshay Kumar, again sharing the female lead (this time with the debuting Lara Dutta).
Chopra played a vivacious young girl who falls in love with Kumar's character.
The "Hindustan Times" noted the glamour that she brought to the role; Kunal Shah of Sify praised her performance and stated she had "all the qualities to be a star."
Her performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut (along with Dutta) and a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.
Chopra's first three releases in 2004—"Plan", "Kismat", and "Asambhav"—performed poorly at the box-office.
Chopra was typically cast during this earlier period as a "glamour quotient", in roles that were considered "forgettable" by film critic Joginder Tuteja.
Later that year she starred with Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar in David Dhawan's romantic comedy "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi", which became the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India and emerged as a major commercial success.
In late 2004, she starred opposite Kumar and Kareena Kapoor in Abbas-Mustan's thriller "Aitraaz".

The film was a critical and commercial success, and Chopra's performance received critical acclaim.
Author Rini Bhattacharya credited her for bringing back the seductress to the silver screen.
The "Hindustan Times" cited it as the film that changed her career significantly.
A reviewer writing for the BBC said, ""Aitraaz" is Priyanka Chopra's film.
As the deliciously wicked, gold digging, scheming seductress, she chews up every scene she is in with her magnetic screen presence."
She won a Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, becoming the second and final actress to win the award after Kajol (the category was discontinued in 2008).
Chopra also received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

Her first two releases—"Blackmail", and "Karam"—were commercially unsuccessful.
Shilpa Bharatan-Iyer of Rediff.com considered "Blackmail" to be a very predictable film and believed that her role as a police commissioner's wife was very limited from an acting point of view.
Her performance in "Karam" was better received, Subhash K. Jha wrote that Chopra "with her poised interpretation of high drama, flies high creating a character whose vulnerability and beauty are endorsed by both the inner and outer worlds created for her character."
Later that year Chopra played the wife of Akshay Kumar in Vipul Amrutlal Shah's family drama "", the story of a small businessman (played by Amitabh Bachchan) who, hiding his illness, wants to teach his irresponsible son some lessons before he dies.

Later that year, Rohan Sippy cast her with Abhishek Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh and Nana Patekar in the comedy "Bluffmaster!"
Chopra played independent working woman Simran Saxena, Bachchan's love interest.
The film proved to be a box-office success.

Co-starring with Hrithik Roshan, Rekha and Naseeruddin Shah, Chopra played a young television journalist who schemes to take advantage of an innocent young man with remarkable physical abilities, but eventually falls in love with him.

Her next film was Dharmesh Darshan's romantic comedy "Aap Ki Khatir", co-starring Akshaye Khanna, Ameesha Patel and Dino Morea.
Neither the film nor Chopra's performance were well received.
Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra's portrayal of Anu was "erratically sketched" and that her character was never consistent: "first flaky, then cool, and later, sensitive".
Chopra's final release of 2006 was Farhan Akhtar's action-thriller "Don" (a remake of the 1978 film of the same name), with Shah Rukh Khan.
Chopra portrayed Roma (played by Zeenat Aman in the original film), who joins the underworld to avenge Don for killing her brother.

The film was declared a box-office success in India and overseas, with revenues of .
Raja Sen of Rediff.com found Chopra to be film's "big surprise"; he believed that Chopra convincingly portrayed Roma, "looking every bit the competent woman of action" and wrote "This is an actress willing to push herself, and has definite potential for screen magic.
Not to mention a great smile."
In 2007, Chopra had two leading roles.
Her first film was Nikhil Advani's "", a romantic comedy in six chapters with an ensemble cast.
She was featured opposite Salman Khan in the first chapter as Kamini, an item girl and aspiring actress who tries to land the lead role in a Karan Johar film with a publicity gimmick.
Film critic Sukanya Verma praised her flair for comedy, especially her impressions of Meena Kumari, Nargis and Madhubala.
Both "Salaam-e-Ishq: A Tribute to Love" and her next film, "Big Brother", proved unsuccessful at the domestic box-office.
In 2008, Chopra starred opposite Harman Baweja in his father's "Love Story 2050".
Chopra played a double role, so she coloured her hair twice; once red to portray the girl from the future and then black for the girl of the past.
Her performance was poorly received; Rajeev Masand was unimpressed with Chopra's chemistry with her co-star, remarking that her character "fails to inspire either affection or sympathy".
She next appeared in the comedy "God Tussi Great Ho", portraying a TV anchor opposite Salman Khan, Sohail Khan and Amitabh Bachchan.
The film was generally perceived to be plagiarised from the Hollywood comedy "Bruce Almighty", although writer and director Rumi Jaffrey claimed it to be "a village folk tale about a Brahmin".
Chopra next starred as a kindergarten teacher in "Chamku" opposite Bobby Deol and Irrfan Khan, and played the role of Sonia in Goldie Behl's fantasy superhero film "Drona" opposite Abhishek Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan.
"Drona", widely criticised for its extensive use of special effects, marked Chopra's sixth film in succession which had failed at both the box-office and critically, although Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated that Chopra displayed convincing action heroine skills.
Critics generally perceived at this time that her career was over.
==========
The string of poorly received films ended when Chopra starred in Madhur Bhandarkar's "Fashion", a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed the lives and careers of several fashion models.
She portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months' consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar's confidence in her.
For the role, Chopra had to gain and steadily shed the weight during the production as the character progressed in the film.
Both the film and her performance received critical acclaim, becoming a major turning point in her career.
Rajeev Masand wrote, "Priyanka Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best."

Her inherent glamorous personality simply disappears into her character.
We don't see the actress on screen at all!
We see only Jhilmil who reminds us in a very pleasant way of Sridevi in "Sadma".
This is one of the most flawless interpretations of a physical-psychological disability seen on celluloid."
