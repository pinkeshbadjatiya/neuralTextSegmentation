After receiving his early education under the Jesuit fathers at St.Aloysius College in Galle, and at the Ceylon University, he joined the Ceylon Law College as an advocate student, and, after obtaining First Class Honours in his Law Final, was enrolled as an Advocate of the Supreme Court in 1939.
He obtained his degree in Laws of the London University in 1942.

In 1942, he joined the Department of the Attorney-General as a crown counsel, and, as a member of the Department, appeared at the Assizes in several important criminal cases for the state on behalf of the attorney-general.
Notable amongst such cases were the Whitehouse murder case, the Wilpattu murder case and the Wirawila Tank murder case.
He also frequently appeared for the state as counsel before the Court of Criminal Appeal.
In 1962, he was appointed solicitor-general, and was leading counsel for the state before the Bandaranaike Assassination Commission.

In 1972, while still serving as a judge of the Supreme Court, he was appointed as a member of the Commission of Inquiry established under the Criminal Justice Commissions Act to inquire into the insurgency of April 1971, and he continued to function as commissioner even after his retirement in July 1974.
