Vanilla Ice
Robert Matthew Van Winkle (born October 31, 1967), known by his stage name, Vanilla Ice, is an American rapper, actor and television host.
Born in South Dallas, and raised in Texas and South Florida, Ice released his debut album, "Hooked", in 1989 on Ichiban Records, before signing a contract with SBK Records, a record label of the EMI Group which released a reformatted version of the album under the title "To the Extreme".
Ice's 1990 single "Ice Ice Baby" was the first hip hop single to top the "Billboard" charts.
Although Vanilla Ice was successful, he later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, which had paid him to adopt a more commercial appearance to appeal to a mass audience and published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge.
After surviving a suicide attempt, Ice was inspired to change his musical style and lifestyle.
While his later, less mainstream albums failed to chart or receive much radio airplay, Ice has had a loyal underground following.
In 2009, Ice began hosting "The Vanilla Ice Project" on DIY Network.
His latest album "WTF – Wisdom, Tenacity & Focus" was released in August 2011.
Ice is currently signed to Psychopathic Records.
==========
Robert Matthew Van Winkle was born in Dallas, Texas, on October 31, 1967.
Van Winkle has never known his biological father; he was given the family name of the Dutch man his mother was married to at the time of his birth.
When Van Winkle was four, his mother divorced.
Afterward, he grew up moving between Dallas and Miami, where his new stepfather worked at a car dealership.
Hip hop affected Van Winkle at an early age, saying "It's a very big passion of mine because I love poetry.
I was just heavily influenced by that whole movement and it's molded me into who I am today."
Between the ages of 13 and 14, Van Winkle practiced breakdancing, which led to his friends nicknaming him "Vanilla", as he was the only one in the group that was not African American.
Although he disliked the nickname, it stuck.
Shortly afterward, Van Winkle started battle rapping at parties and because of his rhymes, his friends started calling him "MC Vanilla."
However, when he became a member of a breakdance troupe, Van Winkle's stage name was "Vanilla Ice" combining his nickname "Vanilla" with one of his breakdance moves; "The Ice".
When Ice's stepfather was offered a better job in Carrollton, Texas, he moved back to Texas with his mother.
He attended R. L. Turner High School for a short time before dropping out.
When Ice was not learning to ride motorbikes, he was dancing as a street performer with his breakdancing group, now called "The Vanilla Ice Posse".
Ice wrote "Ice Ice Baby" at the age of 16, basing its lyrics on a weekend he had with friend and disc jockey D-Shay in South Florida.
The lyrics describe Ice and Shay on a drug run that ends in a drive-by shooting while praising Ice's rhyming skills.
==========
In 1985, he was focusing all of his energy on motocross, winning three championships.
After breaking his ankle during a race, Ice was not interested in racing professionally for some time, using his spare time to perfect his dance moves and creating his own while his ankle was healing.
Ice used his beatboxing and breakdancing skills as a street performer with his friends at local malls during this time.
One evening he visited City Lights, a South Dallas nightclub, where he was dared to go on stage by his friend Squirrel during an open-mic.
He won the crowd over and was asked by City Lights manager John Bush if he wanted to perform regularly, which he accepted.
Ice would be joined on stage with his disc jockey D-Shay and Zero as well as Earthquake, the local disc jockey at City Lights.
The Vanilla Ice Posse or "The V.I.P."
would also perform with Ice on stage.
As a performer for City Lights, Ice opened up for N.W.A, Public Enemy, The D.O.C., Tone Lōc, 2 Live Crew, Paula Abdul, Sinbad and MC Hammer.
In January 1987, Ice was stabbed five times during a scuffle outside of City Lights.
After spending ten days at the hospital, Ice signed a contract with the owner of City Lights, Tommy Quon and his management company, Ultrax.
Two years later, Ice would open for EPMD, Ice-T, Stetsasonic, and Sir Mix-A-Lot on the Stop the Violence Tour.
Quon saw commercial potential in Ice's rapping and dancing skills.
Buying studio time with Quon's earnings from City Lights, they recorded songs that had been perfected on stage by Ice and his acquaintances with various producers, including Khayree.
The two year production was distributed by an independent record company called Ichiban Records in 1989.
"Play That Funky Music" was released as the album's first single, with "Ice Ice Baby" appearing as the B-side.
Tommy Quon personally sent out the single to various radio stations around the US, but the single was seldom played and when it was, it did not get the reaction Quon was hoping for.
When disc jockey Darrell Jaye in Georgia played "Ice Ice Baby" instead of the single's A-side, the song gained a quick fanbase and other radio stations followed suit.
Quon financed $8,000 for the production of a music video for "Ice Ice Baby", which received heavy airplay by The Box, increasing public interest in the song.
Following the success of "Ice Ice Baby", record producer Suge Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Ice was eating.
After shoving Ice's bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards sat down in front of Ice, staring at him before finally asking "How you doin'?"
Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions.
Eventually, Knight showed up at Ice's hotel suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by a member of the Oakland Raiders.
According to Ice, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw him off the balcony unless he signed the publishing rights to the song over to Knight; Knight used Ice's money to help fund Death Row Records.
==========
On the basis of Ice's good looks and dance moves, Public Enemy tried to convince their producer, Hank Shocklee, to sign Ice to Def Jam, but Ice later signed a contract with SBK Records in 1990.
SBK remixed and re-recorded "Hooked" under the title "To the Extreme".
The reissue contained new artwork and music.
According to Ice, SBK paid him to adopt a more commercial, conventional appearance.
This led Ice to later regret his business agreements with SBK.
"To the Extreme" became the fastest selling hip hop album of all time, spending sixteen weeks at #1 on the "Billboard" 200 and selling eleven million copies.
SBK Record executive Monte Lipman stated that he received calls from radio stations reporting over 200 phone calls requesting Ice Ice Baby.
SBK wanted Ice on the road as soon as possible.
MC Hammer, an old acquaintance from his club days, had Ice on as an opening act on his tour.
Reviews of "To the Extreme" were mixed.
"Entertainment Weekly" reviewer Mim Udovitch gave the album a B, citing "Ice Ice Baby", "Play That Funky Music", "Dancin'" and "It's a Party" as the album's highlights.
Robert Christgau gave the album a C− rating, writing that Ice's "suave sexism, fashionably male supremacist rather than dangerously obscene, is no worse than his suave beats".
Criticizing the technique and style of Vanilla Ice, Allrovi reviewer Steve Huey wrote:
In late 1990, Ice began an eight-month relationship with Madonna, and appeared in photographs for her book, "Sex".
In the height of Ice's popularity, SBK licensed a 12" doll which was made by THQ.
In January 1991, he was the musical guest on "Saturday Night Live".
Ice branched out into the film industry with an appearance in the film "", which he later called "one of the coolest experiences" of his career.
Ice was very secretive about his personal life, with the intention of protecting his family.
When a Dallas Morning News reporter asked Ice what his mother's profession was, he replied "None of your fucking business".
In an attempt to rectify this, his former label wrote a fake biography in his name and tried to pass it off as his official life story without his knowledge.
While on tour in 1991, Ice found out that SBK had instigated the publication of the biography which detailed false biographical information, including claims that he had attended school with Luther Campbell and exaggerating his living conditions in Miami, which Ice later had to debunk by himself.
Ice's second major release was the live album "Extremely Live", released in March 1991.
The album was a live recording during Vanilla Ice's performance in Miami during his To The Extreme tour.
Premiering new songs like "Rollin' in My 5.0", "Road To My Riches" and "Satisfaction", the album peaked at #30 on the "Billboard" 200, but it received mainly negative reviews, with "Entertainment Weekly" reviewer David Browne calling it "one of the most ridiculous albums ever released", comparing it to "The Best of Marcel Marceau", an album which consisted of two sides of silence opened by brief applause.
According to Browne, "Extremely Live" "affords you the chance to hear inane stage patter [...] and unaccompanied drumming, during which, one assumes, Ice and his posse are onstage dancing."
Monte Lipman later stated that SBK only released the live disc to make more money from Ice's fame.
In April 1991, Ice began to film the SBK produced "Cool as Ice", in which he played a leading role.
"Cool as Ice" opened on October 18, 1991 in 393 theaters in the United States, grossing $638,000, ranking at #14 among the week's new releases.
Reviews of the film were negative.
Film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 8%.
Ice received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star.
SBK stated that they overexposed Ice and Ice decided to stop taking their business advice as well as distancing himself from the image that SBK was trying to create for him.
In late 1991, Ice appeared in the Circus of the Stars and Sideshow, driving his motorcycle through a wall of fire.
While his fame in the United States had severely dropped, Ice continued touring in 1992, playing in South America, Europe, Australia and Asia, premiering new songs like "Get Loose", "The Wrath", "Now & Forever", "Where the Dogs At?
(All Night Long)", "Minutes of Power" and "Iceman Party".
After a performance in Acapulco, the city honored Ice with a medal that represented "all the respect and admiration to [Ice's] music and to [him] as an artist from the Mexican people".
Ice also served as a spokesperson for Nike and Coca-Cola throughout 1991 and 1992.
In 1993, Ice toured Eastern-Europe again and premiered songs off his upcoming album in St. Petersburg, Russia in front of President Boris Yeltsin.
==========
After almost non-stop touring for the previous three years, Ice took a break from music in 1993 and began competing in jet skiing (becoming the 6th best jet ski racer in the world and obtaining sponsorship from Kawasaki) as well as resuming Motocross racing.
Ice was interested in responding to his critics by having his next album surpass his earlier and popular work.
In 1992, he started writing response songs aimed at 3rd Bass and Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.
Together with his disc jockey Zero, the new album started production yet again, scrapping a lot of finished songs and re-doing others.
By 1994, Ice received less publicity and became removed from the public spotlight.
After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis.
On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, "Mind Blowin'".
Reviews were unfavorable.
"Entertainment Weekly" reviewer James Bernard called the album "more clunky than funky".
"Rolling Stone" reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song "Get Loose" as "snappy", writing that although the lyrics are "inane", "the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up.
He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ...
In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics."
Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that "There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing."
Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: "That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people."
When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said "A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time".
Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt.
At around this time, Ice began using ecstasy, cocaine and heroin.
During periods of heavy drug use, Ice received many tattoos from artist acquaintances.
According to Ice, he "was in [his] binge days.
[He] didn't even realize how many [he] was getting".
Ice attempted suicide with a heroin overdose on July 4, 1994 but was revived by his friends.
After being revived, Ice decided that it was time to change his lifestyle.
As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach.
After expanding his Mind Blowin tour overseas in 1995, Ice sold his estate in California and took a break from music, rather focusing on motocrossing and jet skiing in Florida.
By the summer Ice was the world's No.
6-ranked sit-down Jet Ski racer, competing nearly every weekend and earning a Kawasaki sponsorship.
He met future wife Laura Giaritta a year after his suicide attempt at a Fourth of July party in 1995.
Uncertain about his future career, Ice studied real estate and started working on the side renovating and selling houses.
In late 1995, Ice set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a grunge band, Pickin Scabz.
The name was set to reflect Ice's career and how he was healing from his suicide attempt and that he was now "picking up the pieces".
Ice expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound he was looking for.
In 1996, longtime associate and friend Monte Lipman signed Ice as an artist for Universal Republic Records.
He did guest vocals with no stage name for the song "Boom" by Bloodhound Gang on their CD "One Fierce Beer Coaster".
Later that year, Ice opened up a Miami-based Extreme sport store that focused mostly on water sports and surfing, which he and girlfriend Laura named after his first mainstream album, '2 The Xtreme'.
==========
Ice later developed a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, who had become known for producing music by Deftones, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sepultura.
Robinson and Ice shared an interest in motocross racing.
Monte Lipman hoped that Robinson would produce a new Vanilla Ice album.
According to Robinson, others had attempted to discourage him from working with Ice, saying it might hurt his reputation.
Rather than being dissuaded, their fear encouraged Robinson who agreed to work with Ice.
In an interview, Robinson stated "It's the most punk-rock thing you could do."
Despite not being happy with his old image, Winkle stated that he never had a problem with his older music.
Ice decided against changing his stage name to something else, as he felt no need to run from his past, despite being uneasy with some of it and started performing again, booking a hundred shows a year.
Ice's third studio album, "Hard to Swallow", featured a darker sound and lyrics than Ice's previous work as well as various mixtures of different styles of hip hop and hard rock which caught the media's attention.
Ice attracted a whole new audience when he started touring again, some who were even unfamiliar with his more mainstream sound.
Despite getting its own audience and going Gold, reviews of the album were generally negative.
Jon Pareles of "The New York Times" wrote "The most earnest new song, "Scars," condemns an abusive father.
The sentiments would sound more genuine if Korn hadn't gotten there first."
Richard Torres of "Rolling Stone" gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while "nothing, however, can redeem Ice's wack boasting," the album "isn't half-bad."
In "The New Rolling Stone Album Guide", Rob Kemp gave the album three out of five stars, writing that it contained Ice's "most convincing music".
A lot of executives at SonyBMG were predicting that the album would do better than 'To The Extreme'.
In promotion of "Hard to Swallow", Ice toured with a seven-piece live band which included bassist Scott Shriner.
The band opened with rock-oriented material from "Hard to Swallow" and concluded with older hip hop songs.
The setlist also included "Power", based upon Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song".
Ice said that writing the songs and performing them were like therapy, as he had tried to hide his anger when making his older songs but Robinson was the first producer who told him to use it to create.
Vanilla Ice was a member of the softball team "The Hip Hop Stars" alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Method Man in a 1999 game shown on MTV Rock N' Jock .
Later in 1999, MTV asked Vanilla Ice to join their cast to "retire" the music video for "Ice Ice Baby" on the MTV special "25 Lame", in which Ice himself was asked to destroy the video's master tape.
When Ice was given a baseball bat, he ended up destroying not only the film but the show's entire set as well.
In 2001, DJ ReAnimator remixed "Ice Ice Baby" with Vanilla Ice re-doing his vocals for the track.
"Ice Ice Baby 2001" was released as a single and music video for the European market spawning a wave of new overseas interest in Vanilla Ice.
Having attracted a following outside of his former mainstream audience, Ice began recording independently, despite still being signed at Universal.
During a recording session, Ice met the all-female American hard rock band from Southern California, Betty Blowtorch.
The late Bianca Halstead bonded with Ice and asked if he wanted to contribute a rap interlude to their track "Size Queen".
On Ice's collaboration with the band, lead vocalist and bassist Halstead was quoted saying "I asked him if he could rap over [the track] and he said he can rap over anything.
And he could!"
Per his stepfather's request, Ice started working with his former manager Tommy Quon again, while hoping to re-create some of the magic that they worked hard on in the early 90's, Ice denied any interest in trying to become big again and that his only passion was music, not fame.
In May 2000, Ice wrestled in a match promoted by Juggalo Championship Wrestling, then known as Juggalo Championshit Wrestling, filling in for Insane Clown Posse member Shaggy 2 Dope, who had been injured during a match.
MTV News reported that Insane Clown Posse would make an appearance on Ice's next album, tentatively titled "Bomb Tha System".
In October 2000, Ice announced that his next album would be titled "Skabz", and that Chuck D was confirmed to appear on the album.
It was initially planned as a double album featuring a disc containing rock-oriented material and a disc of hip hop songs.
In July 2001, Ice performed at the second Gathering of the Juggalos.
On October 23, 2001, "Skabz" and "Bomb Tha System" were released as a together as "Bi-Polar".
The album also featured La the Darkman, Perla, Insane Poetry and Bob Kakaha.
Bradley Torreano of Allrovi disliked the album, criticizing it as "wildly uneven and at times hilariously bad", but also stating "Vanilla Ice is still better than a lot of the rap-metal bands that erupted in 2000/2001."
and the rap beats on "Bomb Tha System" "are surprisingly solid".
In "The New Rolling Stone Album Guide", Rob Kemp gave the album one out of five stars, calling the album "utterly listless".
According to a Sony BMG executive, sales of "Bi-Polar" were "not bad...for Vanilla Ice.
That's pretty respectable.
Seriously."
==========
With Quon back as manager, Ice was scheduled to appear in various reality TV programs.
Ice, still an entertainer at heart, felt that the experience would be good for him.

On August 2, 2005, Ice released his fifth studio album, "Platinum Underground".
Ice stated that the title of the album reflected the fact that he could maintain a fanbase without mainstream airplay.
Allrovi reviewer Rob Theakston panned the album, writing that it "has more bad spots in it than most".
Ice made a song titled "Ninja Rap 2" which was set to be a hardcore remix.
Aside the name, the song has very little connection to Ice's original 1991 single, but rather talks about his appreciation to his fans, his love to perform at clubs and playing at the Gathering of the Juggalos with Insane Clown Posse.
"Ninja Rap 2" was the first song to be released from "Platinum Underground" and was available to download for free off of Ice's official website.

at the label's request.
The album was released on November 4, 2008, and contained covers of songs by Public Enemy, House of Pain, Bob Marley, and Cypress Hill.
IGN reviewer Spence D. called the album "an embarrassing endeavor that sounds like it should have stayed locked inside Ice's studio (or at the very least leaked on YouTube and passed off as a piss take)."

Girls and stuff.
That's what is going through my head."
When asked about his darker sound in 2002, Ice replied; "Music is about reflection and I’m just reflecting my life and everything it’s been and there’s no way I’m going to be able to stress what I want and mean over a break beat, you know, it’s too emotional and it’s too intense, so you have to have the intensity of the band, it’s like a symphony, you know, you have to build on the intense parts, and so it just wasn’t going to happen, to come extreme over some hip hop record, so to exorcise my demons I had to have the band."
==========
Along with Beastie Boys, 3rd Bass, and House of Pain, Ice was one of the earliest white rappers to attain major success.

In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say "I give him credit, I think he’s talented, I think he’s a killer rapper, you know I don’t compare myself to him because he’s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don’t colorize hip hop, it’s stupid, but for people who are doing that are just looking through the eyes of a racial standpoint, and it really shouldn’t be looked at that way, you’re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don’t need to compare us two.
Following me, any white rapper is going to have to hear 'oh, you think you’re Vanilla Ice?
', so I am sure he’s heard that."
In April 2009, Ice appeared in the music video for Eminem's song "We Made You".
