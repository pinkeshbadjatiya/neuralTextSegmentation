Randy Orton
Randal Keith "Randy" Orton (born April 1, 1980) is an American professional wrestler and actor who is signed with WWE, where he is a member of the "SmackDown" brand.
He is a 12-time world champion, having held the WWE Championship/WWE World Heavyweight Championship eight times and the World Heavyweight Championship four times, and was the final holder of the World Heavyweight Championship.
Orton is a third-generation professional wrestler; his grandfather Bob Orton, Sr., his father "Cowboy" Bob Orton, and his uncle Barry Orton all competed in the professional wrestling business.
Before being promoted to the main World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) roster, Orton trained in and wrestled for Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling for a month.
He was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he held the OVW Hardcore Championship twice.
Orton became a member of the stable Evolution shortly after his WWE debut, which quickly led to a Intercontinental Championship reign, his first title with the company.
He also acquired the moniker "The Legend Killer" during a storyline where he began disrespecting and then physically attacking WWE Hall of Famers and wrestling veterans.
At age 24, he became the youngest person ever to hold the World Heavyweight Championship.
With this win, he departed from Evolution and a feud with his former stablemates began.
In 2006, Orton joined forces with Edge in a tag team known as Rated-RKO.
Together, they held the World Tag Team Championship.
After Rated-RKO disbanded in mid-2007, Orton gained two WWE Championship reigns in one night, and at 27, he became the youngest two-time WWE Champion.
He formed the group The Legacy with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase in 2008.
It disbanded in 2010 and Orton returned to singles competition.
From 2013 to 2015, Orton was aligned with The Authority, who named him the "face of the WWE".
Overall, he has won 14 total championships in WWE.
He is also the winner of the 2009 Royal Rumble match and has headlined many pay-per-view events for the organization, including WrestleManias XXV and XXX.
==========
Orton was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, the son of Bob Orton, Jr. and his wife Elaine.
He is the grandson of Bob Orton, Sr. and the nephew of wrestler-turned-musician Barry Orton.
He has two younger siblings named Nate and Rebecca.
Knowing the hardships of life as a professional wrestler, Orton's parents tried to convince him to stay away from the business, and his father warned him that life in the ring meant a life on the road and away from family.
Orton attended Hazelwood Central High School, where he was an amateur wrestler.
==========
After graduating from high school in 1998, Orton enlisted with the United States Marine Corps.
At the base, he received a bad conduct discharge a year later after going absent without leave on two occasions and disobeying an order from a commanding officer.
Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, he was tried and convicted under a special court-martial, subsequently spending 38 days in a military prison.
==========
Orton made his wrestling debut in 2000 at the Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling (MMWA-SICW) in St. Louis, Missouri, an offshoot of the historic St. Louis Wrestling Club headed by Sam Muchnick.
There, he was trained by both the promotion and his father, Bob Orton Jr..
He wrestled for the promotion for one month, where he performed with wrestlers such as Ace Strange and Mark Bland.
Orton also refereed a few matches with World Organized Wrestling, a promotion where his uncle Barry Orton worked.
==========
In 2001, Orton signed a deal with the then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was sent to its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued his training.
During his time in OVW, Orton wrestled the likes of Rico Constantino and The Prototype and teamed with Bobby Eaton during a tag team title tournament.
He won the OVW Hardcore Championship twice by defeating Mr. Black on February 14, 2001, and Flash Flanagan on May 5, 2001, respectively.
On several occasions he faced Rico Constantino on combined WWF/OVW events, and also lost to The Prototype (John Cena) in a tag match on July 28 in Jacksonville, IN.
He also began appearing on several WWF house shows that were unaffiliated with OVW, the first being on May 1, 2001 when he faced Billy Gunn.
After taking the mic and promising to beat Gunn, Orton was defeated.
That fall he began appearing regularly on WWF house shows and dark matches, facing Chuck Palumbo, Steven Richards, and Shawn Stasiak, but mostly wrestling in tag team matches.
==========
One of Orton's first official WWF appearances was March 16, 2002 at WrestleMania X8's Fan Axxess, where he was defeated by Tommy Dreamer.
Orton's first televised WWF match was against Hardcore Holly on "SmackDown!"
on April 25, 2002.
Soon after, Orton became a fan favorite and was placed in a series of matches with Holly.
In September 2002, Orton was drafted to the Raw brand, where he defeated Stevie Richards in his debut on the show.
Within weeks of his debut on the Raw brand, Orton suffered a shoulder injury, leaving him sidelined for months.
While recovering, Orton still appeared on "Raw" in his own "Randy News Network" segment, a weekly vignette featuring him talking about his condition.
The show interrupted other segments of Raw programming, which caused Orton to slowly transition himself into a narcissistic and self-centered villain.
After his injury healed, Orton joined the Evolution stable, which consisted of Ric Flair, Triple H, and relative newcomer, Dave Batista.
The group was pushed on "Raw" from 2003 to 2004, with the height of their dominance occurring after Armageddon in 2003 when all of the men's titles on Raw were held by the members of Evolution.
In 2003, Orton spent much of his time helping Triple H overcome challenges for the World Heavyweight Championship.
Orton joined Triple H in a six-man Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, involved primarily to secure Triple H's title defense, and was eliminated by Goldberg, but the stable managed to fulfill its purpose and Triple H went on to eliminate Goldberg and thus retain his title.
Afterwards, Orton proclaimed himself "The Legend Killer", a young upstart who was so talented that he touted himself as the future of professional wrestling.
He embarked on numerous storyline feuds with "legendary" wrestlers and gained infamy for his blatant disrespect of many older, well-respected names in wrestling history.
With the help of his stablemate and mentor Ric Flair, he defeated Shawn Michaels at Unforgiven in the first of many high-profile matches billed as "Legend versus Legend Killer."
Orton then spat in the face of Harley Race on the April 26, 2004 "Raw".
During this time, Orton began using the move that would become his signature finisher, the RKO, a jumping cutter named after his initials.
Orton soon defeated Rob Van Dam for the Intercontinental Championship at Armageddon on December 14, 2003.
With this win, Orton started the longest Intercontinental Championship reign in seven years, holding the title for seven months.
Orton continued to establish himself as a "Legend Killer" throughout 2004, challenging the semi-retired wrestler Mick Foley.
Famed for his hardcore matches and ability to handle excruciating pain, Foley offered Orton a hardcore "Legend versus Legend Killer" match for his Intercontinental Championship.
At Backlash, in a bloody match involving thumbtacks and barbed wire, Orton defeated Foley.
Two months later at Bad Blood, he retained the Intercontinental Championship against Shelton Benjamin.
In July, at Vengeance, Edge defeated Orton to win the Intercontinental Championship, ending Orton's seven-month title reign.
After losing the Intercontinental Championship, Orton became the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship after winning a 20-man battle royal on July 26.
At SummerSlam, Orton defeated Chris Benoit for the championship.
Orton became the youngest person ever to hold the title in WWE history at the age of 24.
Benoit congratulated Orton after the match, shaking his hand for showing the ability to "be a man".
The following night, after Orton successfully defended the championship against Benoit in a rematch, Evolution threw Orton a mock celebration, only to reveal that they were not pleased with his new victory.
While Batista had Orton propped on his shoulders in elation, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs up and then abruptly changed it to a thumbs-down, which was followed by Batista's dropping Orton to the mat.
Ric Flair and Batista attacked Orton in the ring as Triple H revealed his jealousy for Orton's title.
He ordered Orton to hand over the championship, but he refused, spitting in Triple H's face and hitting him with the title belt.
Orton's break-up with Evolution began a new storyline for him as a fan favorite when he continued to feud with his former stablemates.
A month later, Orton lost his championship to Triple H at Unforgiven.
Seeking revenge, Orton lashed out at Evolution members, catching them by surprise during a show by giving them a large cake as a make-up gift, which he came out of to beat and humiliate the group.
At Taboo Tuesday, Orton defeated Ric Flair in a Steel Cage match.
After this, Orton experienced another push, becoming General Manager of the Raw brand for a week following a match stipulation at Survivor Series where he picked up the win for his team by last pinning Triple H in a 4-on-4 Survivor Series match.
He continued to feud with Triple H, using his authority to place his opponents at severe disadvantages during title defenses.
Orton was granted another chance at the championship in January 2005, but lost a six-man championship Elimination Chamber match to Triple H at New Year's Revolution.
On the January 10 "Raw", Orton defeated Batista to earn a match against Triple H at the Royal Rumble for the World Heavyweight title.
At the Royal Rumble, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the World title.
==========
Orton began an on-screen relationship with Stacy Keibler and briefly feuded with Christian in February 2005.
On the February 28 "Raw", Superstar Billy Graham made an appearance, in which he advised Orton to "go where no wrestler [had] gone before".
Orton then produced a copy of "SmackDown!"
magazine, which featured The Undertaker on the cover.
Heeding Graham's advice, Orton said he would set himself apart from all other wrestlers by ending The Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania.
Throughout March 2005, Orton taunted The Undertaker, claiming he was unafraid of him.
On the March 21 "Raw", Orton turned into a villain once more after he delivered an RKO to his unsuspecting on-screen girlfriend, Stacy Keibler, knocking her unconscious.
During Orton's promos, he ran for cover whenever signs of The Undertaker's appearance (lightning, darkness, or smoke) occurred.
When legendary wrestler Jake Roberts advised Orton not to underestimate The Undertaker, Orton performed an RKO on Roberts as well.
In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, Orton became more defiant and unafraid of The Undertaker, taunting and assaulting him in the ring following distractions from his father, "Cowboy" Bob Orton.
At WrestleMania 21, however, the heavily hyped match was unsuccessful for Orton, as he lost despite his father's interference.
The following night on "Raw", Orton faced Batista, who had become World Heavyweight Champion.
Orton stated on-screen that his match with The Undertaker had aggravated a shoulder injury.
While sidelined, Orton appeared on "Raw" and claimed that he was ineligible for the WWE Draft Lottery due to his injury.
He was informed by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon that he was indeed a candidate for the draft, leaving a possibility of a return to "SmackDown!".
Orton returned to WWE programming for the SmackDown!
brand on June 16, announcing that he was the second pick in the 2005 draft lottery.
He rekindled his feud with The Undertaker, defeating him at SummerSlam following a distraction from his father.
Two months later, Orton and his father Bob Orton defeated The Undertaker in a Handicap Casket match, after the match Randy Orton and his father Bob locked the Undertaker in the casket and, in a move similar to Kane at the 1998 Royal Rumble, chopped holes in the top of the casket with an axe, poured gasoline over the casket and set it ablaze, kayfabe killing The Undertaker.
The following month, Orton was a participant in the annual elimination match of Team SmackDown against Team Raw at Survivor Series.
In the match, Orton was the last remaining wrestler in the match for the third straight year., as he pinned Shawn Michaels to get the victory for Team SmackDown.
At the event, The Undertaker returned by emerging from a flaming casket and attacking the SmackDown superstars who had come to the ring to celebrate Team SmackDown's victory.
On the "SmackDown!
"'s episode after Survivor Series, The Undertaker interfered in a match between Rey Mysterio and Big Show after Kane interfered.
Randy Orton RKO'd the Undertaker, he then struck the Undertaker with a tire iron and set him on the back of the lowrider Mysterio had driven to the ring, he then reversed the lowrider into the SmackDown set, causing an explosion.
The feud was finally settled with a Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon, where The Undertaker offered to retire if he lost.
On December 16, The Undertaker entered the ring to deliver a promo while one of his druids appeared to be standing in the ring.
The Undertaker sustained an RKO from Orton in a surprise attack.
The druid revealed himself to be Orton's father, who gave Orton The Undertaker's urn, which, according to the storyline, allowed whomever held it to control The Undertaker.
The Undertaker, however, beat both Ortons in a Hell in a Cell match, ending their nine-month-long feud.
Following Armageddon, Orton entered the 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, but he was eliminated by Rey Mysterio.
Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged him to put the title shot at stake in a match at No Way Out.
In the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, in an attempt to gain villain heat.
Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005.
Orton won at No Way Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22.
General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle.
On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.
On April 4, 2006, Orton was suspended for sixty days for "unprofessional conduct."
In an interview, Orton stated, "my conduct was unbecoming of a champion, which is what I will be again when I return".
To cover for the suspension, a scripted injury was devised, where Kurt Angle broke Orton's ankle during a grudge match.
Orton returned from his suspension in June to the Raw brand, where he entered a rivalry with Angle, culminating in matches at One Night Stand and Vengeance before engaging in a storyline feud with Hulk Hogan.
Orton began cutting promos insulting the aging Hogan and flirted with Hogan's then-eighteen-year-old daughter Brooke.
At SummerSlam, the two met in a "Legend vs. Legend Killer" match, which Hogan won.
After the newly reformed D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) cost Edge the WWE Championship numerous times, Edge approached Orton and asked him to join forces to defeat the team.
Orton, whose championship reign had been ended by Triple H in 2004, agreed, forming the tag team Rated-RKO.
The two became the first to defeat DX since their reunion and quickly dominated the Raw brand's tag team division to become World Tag Team Champions.
As part of the angle, Rated-RKO attacked Ric Flair with steel chairs to enrage DX on November 27.
At New Year's Revolution, Rated-RKO faced DX in a title defense, but the match was declared a no-contest when Triple H suffered a legitimate injury during the match.
With Triple H out of action, Rated-RKO continued their on-screen rivalry with remaining DX member Shawn Michaels.
Michaels teamed with John Cena to defeat Rated-RKO for the tag team championship on January 29.
After losing the tag team titles, both Edge and Orton focused on the WWE Championship, causing friction in the group.
They lost a triple threat match against Shawn Michaels to earn a title match at WrestleMania 23.
They both competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at the same event, but the match was won by Mr. Kennedy.
Finally, they faced off in a fatal four way for the title against Cena and Michaels at Backlash, however Cena retained the title.
Their alliance was effectively ended once Edge was drafted to Smackdown.
Orton then continued his "Legend Killer" persona, attacking Shawn Michaels.
Using frequent attacks to the head, including an elevated DDT and a running punt to the face, Orton defeated Michaels at Judgment Day.
When the kayfabe wounded and concussed Michaels collapsed in the ring, the referee was forced to stop the match and award Orton the victory.
Orton continued his attacks when he engaged himself in feuds with Rob Van Dam, Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, and Sgt.
Slaughter.
During this time the commentators noted how Orton slithers around and stalks his victims like a snake; this led to "The Viper" becoming a nickname for Orton.
==========

Three times before their scheduled bout at SummerSlam, Orton assaulted Cena with the RKO.

That night, Orton interfered in Cena's match, assaulting him before kicking his father, who was at ringside, in the head.
McMahon granted Orton his rematch at Unforgiven, which he won by disqualification when Cena refused to stop punching him in the corner; however, Cena retained the championship because titles cannot change hands by disqualification.
After the match, Cena's father, who was again at ringside, kicked Orton in the head, which led to a match the next night on "Raw", in which Orton defeated Cena's father by disqualification, then hit him with an RKO on him while Cena was handcuffed to the ropes.

He then restarted his feud with John Cena, who had returned from injury to win the 2008 Royal Rumble match.

This infuriated Mr. McMahon, who demanded that Orton apologize, or he'd terminate him on the spot.
As Mr. McMahon was about to fire him, Orton attacked him and punted him in the head, leading to him being carried out of the arena on a stretcher.
On January 25, Orton won the Royal Rumble match, last eliminating Triple H. The next night on "Raw", Orton claimed that he suffered from IED, and that he was not responsible for his actions towards Mr. McMahon, claiming that he suffered a "loss of control" because of the disorder.
He also claimed that WWE knew of the condition, but did nothing, and threatened to sue WWE for that reason, and also, if Stephanie were to fire him, threatened a second lawsuit for breach of contract, due to the fact that he was legally entitled to compete at WrestleMania because he won the Royal Rumble.
Though Stephanie teased firing Orton, she changed her mind and said she had "bigger plans", leading to Shane McMahon returning to "Raw" and attacking Orton.
This led to Orton facing Shane in a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out, which he won.
The next night on "Raw", Orton faced Shane again in an unsanctioned match, which ended in no contest when he punted Shane in the head, thus rendering him unable to continue the match.
Stephanie then ran down to the ring to tend to her brother, but Orton attacked her with an RKO.
This drew Triple H into the feud, who claimed that Orton "crossed the line" when he attacked Stephanie, his real-life wife.
Later, Orton claimed that everything he had done was part of a plan to get revenge on Triple H after he kicked him out of Evolution; according to Orton, Triple H "ruined his life", so Orton was going to do the same and take everything that Triple H cared about away from him.
