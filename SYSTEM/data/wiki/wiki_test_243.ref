UK Rock Challenge
The UK Rock Challenge is the British arm of the Global Rock Challenge.
The Rock Challenge is an anti-drug and crime-prevention that takes the form of a friendly performing arts competition for schools and colleges.
Originating in Australia in the 1980s, it reached UK shores due to Inspector Mark Pontin of the Hampshire Constabulary seeing it in 1995 and being so impressed that he persuaded the Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary to introduce it into their area of the UK.
The first UK event took place in Portsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth in 1996 involving 11 schools and around 750 young people; since then, Rock Challenge has expanded into many areas across the UK; in 2016 there are 49 days of events.
All the events in the UK are funded by the Be Your Best Foundation (Registered Charity Number 1077291), a non-profit charity set up by the creators of the Rock Challenge in the UK who source funding for the events across the UK.'
==========
The premise of the Rock Challenge is that each school puts together an 8-minute dance and drama production on a theme of their choice set to a soundtrack of commercially available music.
Over the course of months/weeks schools create their production and finally bring it to an event day held at a professional venue where they spend the day rehearsing and preparing for an evening show where parents, peers, community members, and invited guests attend.
During the evening, a panel of judges give verbal feedback on each performance and also score each piece based on strict criteria.
Performances are judged on:
Performance Judge
Marks:
Production Judge
Marks:
Drama and Design Judge
Marks:
Each judge also gives the performance a mark for 'Overall Impact' out of 5.
At the end of the evening a prize ceremony is held where a number of awards are presented along with the announcement of the top-scoring schools.
==========
The core message of the Be Your Best Rock Challenge is to show young people how they can achieve a 'natural high' on life rather than with the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco - the concept is that through participation in the event at a professional venue with a professional production and technical crew, the students are helped in the belief that they can achieve a high on life rather than relying on substances.
This is emphasised during the event where everyone is warned that if anyone is caught smoking, taking drugs or drinking alcohol the individual/s concerned will be asked to leave and their team will be deducted two overall ranking places (making it impossible for them to win or go further in the competition).
Participation in the Rock Challenge has shown to have many positive effects on participants, schools, and communities, including:
==========
Rock Challenge has been running in the UK since 1996 (see above) and has been running as the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge in Australia since 1980 (see History in Rock Eisteddfod Challenge page) and has reached out across the world to New Zealand (Stage Challenge), Japan (Rock Challenge Japan), Germany, South Africa (ARA Be Your Best Rock Challenge) and UAE (set up by the British Be Your Best Rock Challenge).
Rock Challenge also had a short and small stay in the US, but there has been no known activity since the confirmation of two events for 2004.
Just like in the UK, since its inception in Australia the events have grown in popularity, so much that the National Finals are shown on the Nine Network over a period of weeks on a Saturday Morning (after being previously recorded live).
This television coverage has been happening since the early 1990s, but since thes UK launch in 1996 it still does not have any major media coverage there.
The most famous participant of Rock Challenge in the UK was the actress Emma Watson from the Harry Potter franchise.
She participated twice, once in 2006 and once as the Rock Challenge leader in 2007 with her school in Oxford.
==========
Rock Challenge is split into 2 age brackets:
Junior Rock Challenge
The Junior Rock Challenge started in the UK in 2005 for participants aged 7–11.
Many Junior Rock Challenges events are not full competitions based on the desires of the local schools and sponsors.
Rock Challenge
Rock Challenge is for participants aged 11–18.
As of 2004, Rock Challenge has been split into 2 competition divisions; the Open and the Premier divisions:
In the 'Open' Division:
In the 'Premier' Division:
From 2007, National Awards have also been awarded, judged nationally by a panel of judges new and independent from those at the live events, announcing each division's top schools in each criteria.
Scottish Grand Final
As of 2012, schools participating in Scottish events will compete at heats for a place in the Scottish Grand Final held in Dundee.
Should a school win the Scottish Grand Final two years in succession they will be given the option of competing in the Northern Region Premier Division for the following year.
Should a school win the Scottish Grand Final three years in succession they will be automatically moved into the Northern Region Premier Grand Final for the following year.
National Grand Final
In 2009 the UK's first National Grand Final was held at the Sheffield Arena.
This consisted of the top 5 schools from each Premier Final along with the top scoring first place from the Open finals (one from the North and one from the South) giving twelve schools: Sandown High School from Sandown, Isle of Wight won this event with their performance 'Cursed' after winning their Open Grand Final.
In 2012 the second UK Rock Challenge National Grand Final was held at the Milton Keynes Theatre, Milton Keynes: Kings Langley School, Hertfordshire won this event with their performance entitled 'Swift as a shadow short as any dream.
'.
==========
Since 1996, the Tour has been to many venues around the country and as Rock Challenge has become larger, so have the venues.
Even just in the first year it grew from one night and one event to 8 venues and 11 nights.
With the planned National Grand Final, it would bring the biggest ever venue ever used by the Rock Challenge team in the UK, The Sheffield Arena with a capacity up to 12,500 seated (downgraded to 4000 seats for Final).
As of 2012 the events will have taken place in the following towns/cities across the UK:
• Aberdeen
• Arbroath
• Basingstoke
• Belfast
• Bournemouth
• Bradford
• Brighton
• Carlisle
• Crawley
• Croydon
• Derby
• Dundee
• Eastbourne
• Grantham

==========
The Be Your Best Foundation is always looking for sponsorship, because they are a charity and this sponsor helps to put on the events.
There is a wide range of sponsors, but not as internationally known as the Australian sponsorship is (like Calvin Klein for one).
In certain areas where the Rock Challenge is there is major backing and sponsorship from the local police force (partly because the introduction to the UK was with the backing of the Hampshire Constabulary).
The One Network Radio stations like Heart FM(formerly known as 2CR FM), Southern FM, Chiltern Radio are also sponsors in their area and this way the Rock Challenge also some times use local presenters from the Radio Stations.
Other Radio stations which are not owned by The One Network are also used for sponsorship (for example both from the Yorkshire Radio Network: The Pulse & Viking FM; Independently owned Lincolnshire based Lincs FM and finally Belfast's Downtown Radio).
Other campaigns for good health, to tackle drugs & alcohol and to promote a better community also appear in the sponsorship.
Just like the Police forces in Rock Challenge tour areas, all the local city and borough councils promote the Rock Challenge (but in the London area there is no definitive sponsorship or backing from the Police or city council).
For the Finals, the sponsorship changes slightly because all the finals are presented by the insurance company Ansvar insurance (which ironically has an Australian parent company) which is a company which helps non-profit organizations and individuals like Charities, helping by investing in certain organizations which work firstly and foremostly in alcohol and drug education (Ansvar Insurance (UK) Website).
In the early announcements over the 2009 national finals it has been said that the success of the event is down highly to the sponsorship gained, to help the staging of the biggest event yet.
