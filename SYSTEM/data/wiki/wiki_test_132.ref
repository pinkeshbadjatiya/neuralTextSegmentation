Yes and no
Yes and no are one of several pairs of words used to express the affirmative and the negative, respectively, in several modern languages including English.
English originally used a four-form system up to and including Early Middle English but Modern English has reduced this to a two-form system consisting of just 'yes' and 'no'.
Some languages do not answer yes–no questions with single words meaning 'yes' or 'no'.
Welsh and Finnish are among several languages that typically employ echo answers (repeating the verb with either an affirmative or negative form) rather than using words for 'yes' and 'no', though both languages do also have words broadly similar to 'yes' and 'no'.
Other languages have systems named two-form, three-form, and four-form systems, depending on how many words for yes and no they employ.
Some languages, such as Latin, do not have yes-no word systems.
The words "yes" and "no" are not easily classified into any of the eight conventional parts of speech.
Although sometimes classified as interjections, they do not qualify as such, and they are not adverbs.
They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right, sentence words, word sentences, or pro-sentences, although that category contains more than "yes" and "no" and not all linguists include them in their lists of sentence words.
Sentences consisting solely of one of these two words are classified as minor sentences.
The differences among languages, the fact that in different languages the various words for "yes" and "no" have different parts of speech and different usages, and that some languages lack a 'yes-no' word system, makes idiomatic translation difficult.
==========
Although sometimes classified as interjections, these words do not express emotion or act as calls for attention; they are not adverbs because they do not qualify any verb, adjective, or adverb.
They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right: sentence words or word sentences.
This is the position of Otto Jespersen, who states that "'Yes' and 'No' [...] are to all intents and purposes sentences just as much as the most delicately balanced sentences ever uttered by Demosthenes or penned by Samuel Johnson."
Georg von der Gabelentz, Henry Sweet, and Philipp Wegener have all written on the subject of sentence words, Wegener calling them "Wortsätze".
Both Sweet and Wegener include "yes" and "no" in this category, with Sweet treating them separately from both imperatives and interjections, although Gabelentz does not.
Watts classifies "yes" and "no" as grammatical particles, in particular "response particles".
He also notes their relationship to the interjections "oh" and "ah", which is that the interjections can precede "yes" and "no" but not follow them.
"Oh" as an interjection expresses surprise, but in the combined forms "oh yes" and "oh no" merely acts as an intensifier; but "ah" in the combined forms "ah yes" and "ah no" retains its standalone meaning, of focusing upon the previous speaker's or writer's last statement.
The forms "*yes oh", "*yes ah", "*no oh", and "*no ah" are grammatically ill-formed.
Aijmer similarly categorizes the "yes" and "no" as "response signals" or "reaction signals".
Ameka classifies these two words in different ways according to context.
When used as back-channel items, he classifies them as interjections; but when they are used as the responses to a yes-no question, he classifies them as formulaic words.
The distinction between an interjection and a formula is, in Ameka's view, that the former does not have an addressee (although it may be directed at a person), whereas the latter does.
The "yes" or "no" in response to the question is addressed at the interrogator, whereas "yes" or "no" used as a back-channel item is a "feedback usage", an utterance that is said to oneself.
However, Sorjonen criticizes this analysis as lacking empirical work on the other usages of these words, in addition to interjections and feedback uses.
Bloomfield and Hockett classify the words, when used to answer yes-no questions, as "special completive interjections".
They classify sentences comprising solely one of these two words as minor sentences.
Sweet classifies the words in several ways.
They are sentence-modifying adverbs, adverbs that act as modifiers to an entire sentence.
They are also sentence words, when standing alone.
They may, as question responses, also be absolute forms that correspond to what would otherwise be the "not" in a negated echo response.
For example, a "No."
in response to the question "Is he here?"
is equivalent to the echo response "He is not here."
Sweet observes that there is no correspondence with a simple "yes" in the latter situation, although the sentence-word "Certainly."
provides an absolute form of an emphatic echo response "He is certainly here."
(Many other adverbs can also be used as sentence words in this way.)
Unlike "yes", "no" can also be an adverb of degree, applying to adjectives solely in the comparative (e.g.
"no greater", "no sooner", but not "no soon" or "no soonest"), and an adjective when applied to nouns (e.g.
"He is no fool."
and Dyer's "No clouds, no vapours intervene.")
Grammarians of other languages have created further, similar, special classifications for these types of words.
Tesnière classifies the French "oui" and "non" as "phrasillons logiques" (along with "voici").
Fonagy observes that such a classification may be partly justified for the former two, but suggests that "pragmatic holophrases" is more appropriate.
==========
While Modern English has a "two-form system" of "yes" and "no" for affirmatives and negatives, earlier forms of English had a "four-form system", comprising the words "yea", "nay", "yes", and "no".
In essence, "yes" and "no" were the responses to a question posed in the negative, whereas "yea" and "nay" were the responses to positively framed questions.
This is exemplified by the following passage from Much Ado about Nothing:
Benedick's answer of "yea" is a correct application of the rule, but as observed by W. A. Wright "Shakespeare does not always observe this rule, and even in the earliest times the usage appears not to have been consistent."
Furness gives as an example the following, where Hermia's answer should, in following the rule, have been "yes":
This subtle grammatical feature of Early Modern English is recorded by Sir Thomas More in his critique of William Tyndale's translation of the New Testament into Early Modern English, which was then quoted as an authority by later scholars:
In fact, More's exemplification of the rule actually contradicts his statement of what the rule is.
This went unnoticed by scholars such as Horne Tooke, Robert Gordon Latham, and Trench, and was first pointed out by George Perkins Marsh in his "Century Dictionary", where he corrects More's incorrect statement of the first rule, ""No" aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative.
", to read "nay".
That even More got the rule wrong, even while himself dressing-down Tyndale for getting it wrong, is seen by Furness as evidence that the four word system was "too subtle a distinction for practice".
Marsh found no evidence of a four-form system in Mœso-Gothic, although he reported finding "traces" in Old English.
He observed that in the Anglo-Saxon Gospels, positively phrased questions are answered positively with "gea" (John 21:15,16) and negatively with "ne" (Luke 12:51; 13:5), "nese" (John 21:5; Matthew 13:29), and "nic" (John 18:17); while negatively phrased questions are answered positively with "gyse" (Matthew 17:25) and negatively with "nâ" (John 8:10).
Marsh calls this four-form system of Early Modern English a "needless subtlety".
Tooke called it a "ridiculous distinction", with Marsh concluding that Tooke believed Thomas More to have simply made this rule up and observing that Tooke is not alone in his disbelief of More.
Marsh, however, points out (having himself analyzed the works of John Wycliffe, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, John Skelton, and Robert of Gloucester, and "Piers Ploughman" and "Le Morte d'Arthur") that the distinction both existed and was generally and fairly uniformly observed in Early Modern English from the time of Chaucer to the time of Tyndale.
But after the time of Tyndale, the four-form system was rapidly replaced by the modern two-form system.
==========
Several languages have a "three-form system", with two affirmative words and one negative.
In a three-form system, the affirmative response to a positively phrased question is the unmarked affirmative, the affirmative response to a negatively phrased question is the marked affirmative, and the negative response to both forms of question is the (single) negative.
For example, in Norwegian the affirmative answer to "Snakker du norsk?"
("Do you speak Norwegian?")
is "Ja", and the affirmative answer to "Snakker du ikke norsk?"
("Do you not speak Norwegian?")
is "Jo", while the negative answer to "both" questions is "Nei".
Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese, Hungarian, German, Dutch, and French all have three-form systems.
Swedish and Danish have "ja", "jo", and "nej".
Norwegian has "ja", "jo"/"jau", and "nei".
Icelandic has "já", "jú" and "nei".
Faroese has "Ja","jú" and "nei."
Hungarian has "igen", "de", and "nem".
German has "ja", "doch", and "nein".
Dutch has "ja", "jawel", and "nee".
French has "oui", "si", and "non".
Swedish, and to some extent Danish and Norwegian, also has additional forms "javisst" and "jovisst", analogous to "ja" and "jo", to indicate a strong affirmative response.
Swedish (and Danish slang) also have the forms "joho" and "nehej", which both indicate stronger response than "jo" or "nej".
"Jo" can also be used as an emphatic contradiction of a negative statement.
==========
Like Early Modern English, the Romanian language has a four-form system.
The affirmative and negative responses to positively phrased questions are "da" and "nu", respectively.
But in responses to negatively phrased questions they are prefixed with "ba" (i.e.
"ba da" and "ba nu").
"nu" is also used as a negation adverb, infixed between subject and verb.
Thus, for example, the affirmative response to the negatively phrased question "N-ai plătit?"
("Didn't you pay?")
is "Ba da."
("Yes."—i.e.
"I did pay.
"), and the negative response to a positively phrased question beginning "Se poate să ...?"
("Is it possible to ...?")
is "Nu, nu se poate."
("No, it is not possible.
"—note the use of "nu" for both "no" and negation of the verb.)
==========
Bloomfield and Hockett observe that not all languages have "special completive interjections".
Finnish does not generally answer yes-no questions with either adverbs or interjections but answers them with a repetition of the verb in the question, negating it if the answer is the negative.
(This is an echo response.)
The answer to "Tuletteko kaupungista?"
("Are you coming from town?")
is the verb form itself, "Tulemme."
("We are coming.")
Negative questions are answered similarly.
Negative answers are just the negated verb form.
The answer to "Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?"
("Do you know Mr Lehto?")
is "En tunne" ("I don't know.")
or simply "En."
("I don't.").
However, Finnish also has particle words for "yes": "Kyllä" (formal) and "joo" (very colloquial).
A yes-no question can be answered "yes" with either "kyllä" or "joo", which are not conjugated according to the person and plurality of the verb.
"Ei", however, is always conjugated and means "no".
It is often said falsely that Welsh has no words at all for "yes" and "no".
It has "ie" and "nage".
However, these are used only in specialized circumstances and are but some of the "many" ways in Welsh of saying yes or no.
As in Finnish, the main way to state yes or no, in answer to yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question.
So the answers to "'" ("Is Ffred coming?")
are either "'" ("He is (coming).")
or "'" ("He is not (coming)").
In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with "nag".
As in Finnish, this avoids the issue of what an unadorned "yes" means in response to a negative question.
While a "yes" response to the question "You don't like strawberries?"
is ambiguous in English, the Welsh response ' has no ambiguity.
The same would apply for Finnish, where the question would be answered with "" (I don't).
For more information on "yes" and "no" answers to yes-no questions in Welsh, see Jones, listed in further reading.
The Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) do not have words for "yes" or "no" at all.
Instead, an echo response of the main verb used to ask the question is used.
Sometimes, one of the words meaning "to be" (Irish ' or ', see Irish syntax § The forms meaning "to be"; Scottish Gaelic ' or ' see Scottish Gaelic grammar § verbs; Manx ' or ') is used.
For example, the Irish question "'" ("Is he coming?")
may be answered """" ("Is") or """" ("Is not").
More frequently, another verb will be used.
For example, to respond to "'" ("Did he hear?
"), "'" ("Heard") or "'" ("Did not hear") are used.
Irish people frequently give echo answers in English as well, e.g.
"Did you hear?"
Answer "I heard/I did".
This also happens in the Galician language.
Latin has no single words for "yes" and "no".
Their functions as intensifiers and interjections are taken up by using the vocative case.
Their functions as word sentence responses to yes-no questions are taken up by "sentence adverbs", single adverbs that are sentence modifiers and also used as word sentences.
There are several such adverbs classed as truth-value adverbs—including "certe", "fortasse", "nimirum", "plane", "vero", "etiam", "sane", "minime", and "videlicet".
They express the speaker's/writer's feelings about the truth value of a proposition.
They, in conjunction with the negator "non", are used as responses to yes-no questions.
For example:
Latin also employs echo responses.
Speakers of Chinese use echo responses as well.
In all languages, yes-no questions are often posed in A-not-A form, and the replies to such questions are echo answers that echo either "A" or "not A".
In Mandarin Chinese, the closest equivalents to "yes" and "no" are to state "是" ("shì"; lit.
"is") and "不是" ("búshì"; lit.
"not is").
(In Cantonese, the preceding are 係 "hai6" and 唔係 "m4 hai6", respectively.)
The phrase 不要 (buyào; lit.
"(I) do not want") may also be used for the interjection "no".
Japanese also lacks words for "yes" and "no".
The words "はい" ("hai") and "いいえ" ("iie") are mistaken by English speakers for equivalents to "yes" and "no", but they actually signify agreement or disagreement with the proposition put by the question: "That's right."
or "That's not right."
For example: If asked, "行かないのですか" ("ikanai no desu ka" / "Are you not going?
"), answering with the affirmative "はい" would mean "Right, I am "not" going"; whereas in English, answering "yes" would be to contradict the negative question.
Echo responses are not uncommon in Japanese.
The words for "yes" and "no" in some languages originate from a process of devaluation and semantic erosion.
The Hungarian strong affirmative "persze" was originally the Latin phrase "per se intelligitur" ("it stands to reason"), for example.
German "nein" similarly is derived from the Old High German "ni ein", which means "not a single one".
(In Latin, "non" similarly devolved from "noenum", which also means "not one".)
The French "oui" was formerly "oïl" (after which Langue d'oïl is named), which, in turn, came from the Vulgar Latin "hoc ille", meaning "this one" ("it is" this one).
In Spanish, the words "sí" (yes) and "no" (no) are unambiguously classified as adverbs: not only do they serve as answers to questions; they also modify verbs.
The affirmative "sí" can replace the verb after a negation ("Yo no tengo carro, pero él sí = "I don't own a car, but he does) or intensify it ("I don't believe he owns a car.
/ He does own one!"
= "No creo que él tenga carro.
/ ¡Sí lo tiene!").
The word "no" is the standard adverb placed next to a verb to negate it ("Yo no tengo carro" = "I don't own a car").
Double negation is normal and valid in Spanish, and it is interpreted as reinforcing the negation ("No tengo ningún carro" = "I own no car").
These differences between languages make translation difficult.
No two languages are isomorphic, even at the elementary level of words for "yes" and "no".
Translation from two-form to three-form systems is something that English-speaking schoolchildren learning French or German soon encounter.
But the mapping is not even as simple as converting two forms into three.
There are many idioms, such as reduplication (in French, German, and Italian) of affirmatives for emphasis (the German "ja ja ja").
Furthermore, the mappings are one-to-many in both directions.
The German "ja" has no fewer than 13 English equivalents that vary according to context and usage ("yes", "yeah", and "no" when used as an answer; "well", "all right", "so", and "now", when used for segmentation; "oh", "ah", "uh", and "eh" when used an interjection; and "do you", "will you", and their various inflections when used as a marker for tag questions) for example.
Moreover, both "ja" and "doch" are frequently used as additional particles for conveying nuanced meaning where, in English, no such particle exists.
Straightforward, non-idiomatic, translations from German to English and then back to German can often result in the loss of all of the modal particles such as "ja" and "doch" from a text.
Translation from languages that have word systems to those that do not, such as Latin, is similarly problematic.
As Calvert says, "Saying yes or no takes a little thought in Latin"
