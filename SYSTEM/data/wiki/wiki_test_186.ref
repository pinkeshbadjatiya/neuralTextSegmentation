The Bahá'í Faith in Morocco began about 1946.

By April 1955 the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Ceuta was elected.
By January 1958 the first Bahá'í summer school was held in Rabat.
By spring 1958 the Bahá'í population may have been 100 and there were six assemblies and a regional committee coordinated activities promulgating the religion.
In 1960 the first all-Moroccan local assembly was elected in Zaouiat Cheikh and most of its members were Berbers.
On December 7, 1961 an article in Al Alam laments the decline of Islam and attacks the Bahá'ís.
During the year Bahá'í homes are entered by police and literature of the religion is taken.

A regional National Spiritual Assembly of North West Africa was organized which included Morocco in 1962.
In 1963 a survey of the community counted 10 Assemblies, 12 organized groups (between 1 and 9 adults) of Bahá'ís.
In 1963 the arrests in Morocco had gotten attention from Hassan II of Morocco, US Senator Kenneth B. Keating and Roger Nash Baldwin, then Chairman of the International League for the Rights of Man and would echo in analyses of politics of Morocco for years to come.
All Bahá'í meetings were prohibited in 1983 followed by arrests.
This time the response emphasized the non-partisan and obedience to government principles of the religion.
1992 estimates by the US Department of State counted some 150-200 Bahá'ís.
while 2001 through 2009 estimates mention the Bahá'í community at 350 to 400 persons.
However Association of Religion Data Archives and Wolfram Alpha estimated 33,000 Bahá'ís in 2005 and 2010, the third largest religion in the country.

In Morocco there were episodes of religious persecution in 1962-1963, on the basis of condemnation from Allal El Fassi when 15 Bahá'ís were arrested for their religious convictions; three were given death sentences.
On December 7, 1961 an article in Al Alam laments the decline of Islam and attacks the Bahá'ís.
During the year Bahá'í homes are entered by police and literature of the religion is taken.
On April 12 four Bahá'ís are arrested in Nador.
In September the Bahá'ís in the United States contacted Hassan II of Morocco during a visit to the United Nations.
On October 31, fourteen Bahá'ís are arrested and are charged with rebellion, disorder, attacks on public security, being an association of criminals, and attacking religious faith.
On 10 December the trial begins with charges of sedition.
On the 14th the verdict is given—four are acquitted as they claim to be Muslims, one is acquitted through family connections, one is released on 15 years probation, five are committed to life imprisonment and three are sentenced to death.
The sentences are appealed to the Moroccan supreme court.
Initially Bahá'ís did not publicize the events.
On December 17, 1962 news is released among the Bahá'ís and efforts are aimed at asking for the applicability of the UN charter which condemns religious intolerance.
On January 31 Roger Nash Baldwin, then Chairman of the International League for the Rights of Man, appeared before a UN sub-commission of Preventing Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and states that, as far as they knew, the Bahá'í prisoners in Morocco are the only example in recent history where members of a religions have been condemned to death solely for holding and expressing religious views regarded as heretical.
This appeal through the UN was supported by nearly the entire body of the Harvard Divinity School.
There were months of diplomatic efforts; US Senator Kenneth B. Keating stated in the U.S. Senate on February 18, 1963, "How far religious freedom under the Moroccan Constitution really applies, will be revealed in the coming weeks when the appeal before the Supreme Court [of Morocco] is heard."
On March 31, 1963 during a visit to the United States and the United Nations, Hassan II of Morocco was interviewed on television on Meet the Press then with Lawrence E. Spivak and was asked about the treatment of Bahá'ís in his own country.
He addressed the audience saying that the Bahá'í Faith was not a religion and "against good order and also morals".
However, on April 2 he makes a public statement that if the Supreme Court confirms the penalty of death that he would grant them a royal pardon.
However, on November 23 the Supreme Court hears the appeals and reversed the decision of the lower court.
On December 13 the prisoners are actually released.
Coverage in newspapers of the day included Wisconsin, Winnipeg and Lethbridge, Canada and Elyria Ohio as well as the New York Times.
"The New Republic" January 25, 1964 issue had an article by Roger Nash Baldwin, founder of the American Civil Liberties Union and member of the International League for the Rights of Man (an organization accredited by the UN which aims to spread civil liberties around the world).
Baldwin mentions how the League, by applying public pressure on the King of Morocco helped save the lives of the Bahá'í prisoners who had been sentenced to death.
Baldwin was quoted discussing the League, "All this adds up to the very tiny beginnings of a system by which the UN itself would examine and process complaints and ultimately help set up a world court of human rights."
"Morocco, Old Land, New Nation" published in 1966 discusses briefly the exploitation of the religion by a Moroccan political party, in an effort to dramatize a claim "to be the stanch defender of faith and country," and the resultant persecution and imprisonment of several young Baha'i men from Nador.
Concerning the Faith, the authors write: "The attractiveness of the movement stemmed from its belief in world brotherhood (a factor in its recent appeal in certain parts of Africa), the dedication of its organizers, and the vitality of its discussions, which contrasted sharply with the small concern in Morocco with the possibility of modernizing Islam."
The reactions of various Moroccan leaders, newspaper publicity, and the final reversal of the convictions are noted.
