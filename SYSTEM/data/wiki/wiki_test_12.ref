==========
The show starts when the previous golden dragon has passed on to the afterlife and Ang and Ling Leung, seventeen-year-old fraternal twins are next in line for the Golden Dragon power band.
Ang has no belief that he will become the Golden Dragon, as Ling is the best fighter at the dragon dojo.
Ling is positive that she will become the Golden Dragon.
However, when Master Chin calls upon the power of the Golden Dragon to choose who will be the next golden dragon, it chooses Ang.
Humiliated and furious, Ling storms out of the temple and is tempted by the ultimate dark and evil power of the shadow dragon.
From then on, Ang is forced to fight his own twin sister.
==========
Trial by Fire, Part 1
Production Number: 101
Airdate: 2006-08-14
The Golden Dragon has died and a new one must be chosen.
There are only two individuals available: Ang Leung and Ling Leung, fifteen year-old twins who are both highly accomplished in martial arts and knowledgeable of the ancient philosophies of the Golden Dragon.
They both start out having a martial arts workout at their Dojo as usual, accompanied by Beingal.
Suddenly, Master Chin arrives and tells them a new Golden Dragon needs to be selected.
Master Chin also tells Beingal to travel back to her temple since she has been selected as Guardian of the Temple of the Tigers.
Everyone sets off, but not before a certain Snake sees and follows them.
Meanwhile, in a forest, warriors invade a temple and go right into the centre to find a statue of Snake.
In the middle of the body, they find pit full of snakes, which start to form a tower and reveals a woman.
She is Cobra, Guardian of the Temple of the Snakes, and they have violated her temple.
She pulls the Powerband of the Snakes out of the Snake Statue’s Mouth and empowers her band, attacking the warriors and managing to defeat them.
However, before she can defeat the last one, a person appears from behind the statue wearing the Zodiac sign and green clothes: he reveals himself as the Zodiac Master.
He immediately places a small tiny disc bomb in the Snake Statues Mouth, causing it to explode and blow all the debris towards Cobra.
It pins her down, allowing enough time for the Zodiac Master to steal her Powerband from her.
Back in Hong Kong, Ling cannot contain herself.
She is overconfident that she will be the Golden Dragon.
Ang is also certain that Ling will be chosen, which would place a great responsibility upon one of them besides great power.
Soon they arrive at the Dragon Temple, entering to find themselves in front of a Dragon head with flames in its mouth.
Master Chin approaches a stage in front of the head showing all the signs of the Zodiac symbols.
The temple begins to glow from the mouth and reveals the Powerband of the Dragons.
The Powerband chooses Ang to be the new Golden Dragon.
Ling, who was too confident in thinking she was going to be the new Dragon, is bitten with jealously.
Feeling humiliated, she tries to take the band away from him but has no luck.
Then, the same man who took Cobra's powerband arrives with his warriors in the temple.
He introduces himself as the Zodiac Master, but Master Chin reveals him as Woo Yin, one of his former students, even though Zodiac Master rejects that name.
Ling immediately attacks the warriors.
Master Chin keeps Ang from fighting until Ling actually defeats all the warriors and is tangled up by King Cobra Snake (Zodiac Master’s Pet).
Ang then empowers the Dragon band and the new Golden Dragon fights the Zodiac Master.
He is eventually defeated and the Snake Powerband now teleports itself to Ang.
The Zodiac Master is now defeated, his Snake Powerband has gone, his warriors are defeated, along with that his plan has failed.
With that, he decides to leave.
Master Chin tells Ang that upon defeat, the Powerbands go to the victor, even to dark forces.
He turns to Ling to tell her that the Golden Dragon has to be someone who knows the responsibility of the power and then leaves.
Ling, vowing that one day she will wear that band, runs out of the temple.
Trial by Fire, Part 2
Production Number: 102
Airdate: 2006-08-14
With Ang being the new Golden Dragon, he searches inside the Dragon Dojo for Ling and finds her by the entrance but is still angry until Master Chin arrives and she yells at him for not being picked as the next Dragon and tells him that she will have it no matter what she has to do to get it and leaves.
Ang tries to go after her, but is stopped by Master Chin because she must choose her own path and they have much work to do.
They descend into the Dragon Temple, where Master Chin gives Ang a lesson on the 12 symbols in front of the Dragon head.
He explains that once the Golden Dragon has managed to get the other Guardians bands back from the Zodiac Master, the bands are to be placed on top of the Zodiac Symbol.
Ang tests with the Snake Powerband they retrieved from the Zodiac Master and places it on top of the Snake Symbol and the image of a Snake then takes the band back to the Temple of the Snakes.
Master Chin goes on to explain these also act as warning beacons: whenever a temple is in danger or has been violated or the Guardian themselves are in danger the symbol will glow and right that second, the Dragon symbol begins to glow, suggesting that someone has broken into the Dragon Temple.
Ang powers up and finds a small male wearing a white-red mask hopping mad round the temple trying to evade Ang.
Outside, Ling is upset and is approached by the Zodiac Master to step into the dark of Yin, while stepping out of the light of Yang.
He takes her to his hideout on a small island filled with all sorts of technology and the Shadow Dragon temple and offers her the chance to be a Dragon as the Shadow Dragon.
Back at the Dragon Temple, Ang eventually catches the fleeing male, Master Chin identifies him as Xuan Chi, Guardian of the Temple of the Monkeys.
He tells his tale of why he is there: three temple raiders raided his temple and kidnapped him along with his Powerband and took much of everything out of the temple.
Xuan Chi however managed to escape and came to the Dragon Temple for help to retrieve his band back, but Ang says he cannot because he says that the band could be anywhere by now and that he has a "nut case called the Zodiac Master" after his own band and has to find Ling.
Later on in the evening, Ang introduces technology to a confused Xuan Chi and watches him play a game on his computer.
Before he can carry on, Ling shows up and Ang asks where she has been, but Master Chin answers it with the Zodiac Master.
At first Ang is in denial that she would not join the Zodiac Master.
But when he empowers his band and sees Ling full of dark energy and asks her what she has done, she replies that she chose her own destiny.
Master Chin confirms that his sister is now their enemy.
Ling then empowers her new band, reveals that she is the new Shadow Dragon and begins to fight Ang.
Ang dodges every attack and does not want to fight her, but soon has no choice when she defeats Xuan Chi in the fight and he defeats her with a single power blast.
She makes a hasty retreat, while Ang wonders how is he ever going to stop the Zodiac Master, now along with the Shadow Dragon, but Master Chin manages to say he will find a way in the long journey ahead of him.
Xuan Chi now joins the two of them on their journey.
