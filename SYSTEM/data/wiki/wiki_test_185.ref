List of Being Human characters
This is a list of fictional characters in the British supernatural drama-comedy television series "Being Human".
The show's central premise follows a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost as they try to live together in modern-day Britain.
Actors Lenora Crichlow, Russell Tovey and Aidan Turner composed the original core cast of the programme's first three series with Sinead Keenan joining the main cast in series 3.
This setup began to change from series 4, and by the fifth series an entirely different werewolf, vampire and ghost trio played by Michael Socha, Damien Molony and Kate Bracken were starring.
==========
Anna Clare Sawyer (Lenora Crichlow), known commonly as "Annie", is a ghost, appearing as she did at the time of her death in her early twenties.
Up until her death, she had been living with her fiancé Owen (whom she later revealed had been her third serious relationship, her previous two having ended when her first boyfriend posted naked pictures of her on the Internet and when her second boyfriend drunkenly invited her mother to form a threesome).
Following her death, she haunted the house in which she and Owen had lived while she was alive, and which Owen was now running as landlord (eventually renting it out to George and Mitchell).
Annie's ability to be seen and heard by normal people depends on her state of mind, although supernatural creatures can always see her.
Annie eventually falls in love with Mitchell and is devastated when he volunteers to be staked by George.
When George and Nina are both killed in a war against the vampires, Annie takes responsibility for their daughter Eve, along with new housemates Tom McNair and Hal.
In the Series 4 finale she sacrifices herself and baby Eve to destroy the Old Ones with a bomb Tom made.
With her unfinished business taken care of, her Door to the other side appears once more, and she passes through it to reunite with her friends.
==========
George Sands, Junior, (Russell Tovey) is a young werewolf in his mid-twenties, and Mitchell's best friend.
He also shares a close, sibling-like friendship with Annie.
Less socially adept than Mitchell, he is considerably more intellectual, possessing an IQ of 156 and being able to speak French, German, Italian, Spanish and Croatian.
George grew up in an average suburban household with what he considered to be a very straightforward family, including a father who possessed none of the handicaps or problems such as alcoholism or gambling which George saw in other peoples' fathers.
(He would reflect later on that at the time he had never realised how important "boring" could be.)
George is Jewish and wears a Star of David pendant.
The pendant is able to hold back one or two vampires, but in greater numbers it becomes less effective; Mitchell is apparently immune to it due to the personal connection between him and George.
It is mentioned in the pilot, however, that George is a lapsed Jew as he believes the faith frowns upon someone turning into a werewolf.
George became a werewolf while on holiday in Scotland.
He was about to go out for a walk when an American tourist, not knowing his way around, invited himself along after George reluctantly let him.
They both got lost as night fell and were attacked by a werewolf–later revealed to be a man named Lee Tully, who later comes looking for him in search of companionship–who killed the tourist and scratched George, who survived when the rescue services found him.
After becoming a werewolf, George left his family, his job and his fiancée, afraid of hurting them.
He works alongside Mitchell as a porter in the local hospital, unable to hold down a more permanent job due to his monthly transformations, which are extremely painful.
George resents being a werewolf to the extent that he is essentially in denial about his condition, often referring to it as "that thing that happens to me once a month".
For the whole of Series 1, he attempts to view his wolf side as an entirely different entity; when referring to his wolf self, he never uses "I" or "me", only an impersonal "it".
His denial ends after the last episode of the first season, when he takes responsibility for his actions as a wolf after accidentally scratching Nina during a transformation whilst trying to protect her from the vampire Herrick.
George attempts to find new ways of coping with his "condition" in Series Two while trying to take action to lead a normal life.
This includes such measures as caging himself and taking tranquilisers before transforming, but this apparently only makes the wolf angrier, resulting in uncontrollable swearing and a more brutal mentality in his human form, as though the wolf was trying to "get out" in revenge for being "chained".
Matters become even worse when he accompanies Sam Danson, his new girlfriend, to her daughter Molly's Parents' Evening, only to nearly transform at the school because he is unaware that the clocks had gone back; although he manages to maintain control of himself long enough to get back to the flat and be locked in his cage by Annie.
Molly's subsequent terror after seeing him mid-transformation prompts George to look into a cure for his condition once again, only to change his mind once again when Annie reminds him that he will be unable to see her as a human.
He reunites with Nina, and they leave the chamber after finding a message from Tully written at the bottom of one of the walls: "George, all the werewolves die".
He and Nina watch Annie being forced through the door and they, and Mitchell, later move to Wales because they are unable to stay in the house after losing Annie.
Having relocated to Barry Island, George and Nina start work at a new hospital, using the basement room of their new house for one of them to remain during the full moon.
However, despite George's belief that he or Nina would kill the other if they transformed next to each other, the two of them apparently have sex while in wolf form.
When Nina discovers the permanently teenage vampire Adam as his elderly father was admitted to the hospital shortly before his death, she and George briefly contemplate taking over responsibility for Adam after his parents' deaths–George speculating that they pretend that Adam was his brother until he and Nina were old enough for them to introduce him as their son–but Adam departs to make his own way, wanting to explore his own independence without being a burden on them like he was on his parents.
As a result of their sexual intercourse while in wolf form, George and Nina are now expecting a baby.
Following Herrick's resurrection, despite his knowledge of what Herrick was in the past, George refuses to allow Mitchell to stake Herrick as he wants to be the kind of father who can legitimately teach his child about redemption and forgiveness, feeling that the now amnesic Herrick deserves the same chance as they had given Mitchell.
When Annie finds a death notice for George's father in the paper, George attends the funeral and encounters what he believes is his father's ghost, only to subsequently learn that his father has actually faked his death after a homeless man burnt to death in his shed after his wife had an affair with George's old P.E.
teacher.
George and Nina are able to convince him to assert himself in his relationship with his wife, the two resuming their relationship with a trip to Cornwall (although they apparently believe that George has HIV rather than that he is a werewolf).
With the discovery that Mitchell was responsible for the Box Tunnel Twenty murders, he returns to the house to ask George to kill him, wanting to ensure that he could not kill anyone else and that George would be freed from the "taint" of helping him escape the consequences of his past sins.
Understandably, George is reluctant to kill his best mate but when vampire Edgar Wyndham states out his intent to use Mitchell as an "attack dog", George carries out Mitchell's request and kills him (telling Mitchell that he is "doing this because he loves him"), and then kills Wyndham, in effect declaring war on the vampires.
The first episode of Series Four, "The Eve of the War", reveals that Nina had subsequently given birth to a daughter.
However, it is also revealed that George's killing of Mitchell and Wyndham has resulted in a revenge attack from the local vampire coven (led by Griffin) who had ambushed Nina on her first trip outdoors after the birth and beat her to death in an alleyway.
At the start of Series Four, a traumatised and grieving George has developed a siege mentality, shutting himself with his as-yet-unnamed baby in a single room in Honolulu Heights and taking up a position of constant vigilance against vampire attacks.
George is lured out of the house by an apparent opportunity to kill Griffin, which turns out to be a trick enabling the vampires to kidnap his baby with the intention of offering her as a gift to the Old Ones.
George subsequently gives himself up to Griffin as an alternative trophy, in order to preserve her life.
In the lair, he forces an off-schedule and partial werewolf transformation by tricking his body into believing that it is the full moon.
Although this enables him to kill Griffin, destroy the coven and save his daughter, it also results in his death from kidney and heart failure following the botched transformation, as his body was undergoing the transformation into a werewolf without activating the accelerated healing that would allow him to cope with the organ damage.
His last acts as he dies are to command Tom to take his place at Honolulu Heights with Annie and to give his daughter a name: Eve.
==========
John Mitchell (Aidan Turner) is a 117-year-old vampire (born on 29 July 1893) with the appearance of a young man in his twenties.
He had chosen to give up drinking blood and preying on humans, attempting instead (insofar as it is possible) to become human, again.
Like other vampires, Mitchell has enhanced strength and sense of smell, and his eyes turn completely dark when he had blood lust or when he wills it; though it appears that he is slightly weaker when he abstained from drinking blood, he could survive without it.
His image cannot be captured on film and he had no reflection in mirrors.
Although he can survive daylight, his eyes are overly sensitive to natural light, prompting him often to wear sunglasses outside in the daytime.
He often wears dark clothing, rings and fingerless gloves.
Publicly quiet and calm, he works as a hospital cleaner (a deliberate choice, as it is a low-status, low profile job, which enables him to live quietly with the minimum of commitments or chances of exposure).
Mitchell is always referred to by his surname by his friends.
Born in 1893 and Irish by birth, Mitchell fought as a young soldier in World War I, when he was originally recruited as a vampire by William Herrick.
He encountered Herrick after a battle, stumbled upon him and several other vampires who were picking through piles of bodies for anyone living to feed on.
Mitchell agreed to feed Herrick and become a vampire in exchange for Herrick leaving the rest of his men alone.
He rejoined his regiment, hoping that no one had realised that he has changed, but became so hungry that he stole poison from the medical supplies, killed one of his friends, and drained his blood before deserting the army and running away.
At some later point, he rejoined Herrick and the vampire community, accepting his new vampire nature.
In his early years as a vampire (and before his conscience was reawakened), Mitchell was quite a hero within the vampire community, who still circulate stories of his exploits amongst themselves.
These seem to be a cause of great guilt for Mitchell who has asked Herrick to stop the retelling of the stories as he would prefer to be forgotten.
At several points, he has faced a conflict of emotions as he debated whether to "convert" people dying around him to prevent their deaths.
In the 1960s, Herrick gave Mitchell the opportunity to kill a young girl that they had lured into their car.
Mitchell showed guilt and anger at the easiness of the kill and let her go.
He told Herrick that she had escaped, prompting the suspicious Herrick to say that he would keep a closer eye on Mitchell.
Mitchell has attempted several times to abstain from drinking blood (one attempt was a New Year resolution for 2000, with the aid of a fellow vampire called Carl).
At this time, Mitchell showed an extreme addiction to blood, as well as heightened aggression, lack of control and extreme panic due to blood withdrawal.
Mitchell's reluctant rescue of the werewolf George from a squad of fellow vampires, and the subsequent development of their friendship, further awakens his conscience, and he eventually opts to drift away from the vampire group in Bristol and to join George in living quietly.
After "converting" Lauren into a vampire (as covered in both the pilot episode and Series One Episode 1), Mitchell, infuriated at himself, decides to fully give up the blood and to attempt "being human" once more.
He continues to take care of George, particularly around the full moon when George transforms.
In episode 3 of Series 2, Mitchell has become the new "king" of the vampire group in Bristol, hiding evidence of their feedings, recreating their human front and intending to wean them off blood, although his activities are hampered by such problems as Ivan–his oldest apparent "recruit"–being unable to completely forsake blood after so long, forcing him to allow Ivan to feed in secret while maintaining his public front.
After the deaths of his vampire group by an explosion at the funeral parlour, subsequently receiving confirmation that they have been betrayed by the coroner despite a deal he had made, Mitchell realises that he has wasted his time trying to hide his blood lust and goes on a frenzy with Ivan's widow Daisy.
Paying a last visit to George and Annie, he briefly seems to return to normal when warning George to stay away from cities in future before returning to his more arrogant, blood-crazed ways.
A confrontation with a priest while searching for Lucy reminds him that George saw him as a good man when he was injured by Herrick, and reveals Lucy's connection to the organisation that seeks to "cure" George and Annie.
Finding the organisation's headquarters, Mitchell confronts Lucy, countering her claims that he and his kind are evil with both the theological argument that God made them just as he made mankind and by pointing out that she killed despite having a choice, but he nevertheless refuses to kill her or Kemp.
He later shows evident grief when Lucy is killed by Kemp.
At the start of Series 3, Mitchell enters Purgatory to rescue Annie (following a terminally ill patient at the hospital where George and Nina now work through the Door after his demise).
Although his mission is successful, he also learns that the time and date of his death have been confirmed, and he would be killed by a werewolf at some unspecified (but apparently not-too-distant) future date.
While claiming to Annie that he has not believed a word of what he heard, Mitchell is in fact increasingly haunted by both the "prophecy" of his death and by the continued police hunt for the person responsible for the "Box Tunnel Twenty" massacre.
He rejects an offer to depart Britain to live with the vampire "Old Ones", commenting during a talk with permanently teenage vampire Adam that his friends help him remain clean as their goodness inspires him by forcing him to think about the disappointment they would feel if he were to succumb to his thirst.
After a confrontation with vampire "fan" Graham, Mitchell tries to tell Annie the truth about the massacre, but Annie simply tells him that whatever he had to tell her does not matter, assuring him that all she wants is the man he is now and that what he had done in the past does not matter compared to what he has done for her and George.
The two finally admit their love for each other and begin a romantic relationship.
Although Annie tries to find ways for their relationship to become physical at first, Mitchell eventually admits that sex has always been about violence rather than love with him, and suggests that their "pure" relationship can be better than a sexual relationship.
Mitchell has a tense relationship with werewolf vampire-hunter McNair due to Mitchell's concerns regarding the "prophecy" of his death (despite having claimed to Annie that he does not believe in fate).
He reaches a certain understanding with McNair once they work together to save George and Nina from a group of vampires, although McNair still feels that Mitchell's sins will catch up to him eventually.
When Herrick returns to life, Mitchell initially attempts to stake him–particularly after Cara stakes herself before being able to tell Mitchell how she and Daisy have brought Herrick back.
He is convinced by George to let Herrick live on the grounds that he deserves the same chances everyone had given Mitchell.
When Annie learns about Mitchell's role in the massacre, she tearfully convinces him to allow himself to be arrested.
Mitchell goes along with it to prove his love for her, even as he tries to escape being processed due to the risks if his true nature is exposed.
Although Herrick releases Mitchell–revealing in the process that his resurrection was aided by the fact that he was torn apart rather than just being staked–Mitchell finally stakes Herrick when he concludes that he has seen and done enough in his life.
On hearing the news that another man has been framed for the Box Tunnel Twenty massacre, Mitchell recognises that other vampires has set up that frame, and will call in a favour from him later.
Sickened by his ultimate inability to escape his past, Mitchell decides that he wants to free his friends of the taint he has brought to their lives.
He returns to Honolulu Heights to ask George to kill him–not realising that he is being followed by Wyndham, one of the Old Ones.
George is initially reluctant to carry out Mitchell's wishes, but once Wyndham has spelled out his plans to use Mitchell as an "attack dog", George stakes Mitchell in order to save him from this final abuse.
George's last words to Mitchell are, "I'm doing this because I love you," to which a grateful Mitchell responds, "I know," before he dies.
==========
Nina Pickering (Sinead Keenan) is a senior staff nurse at the hospital in which Mitchell and George work, with a fiery and strong manner that can be intimidating.
She initially views George as a bumbling, arrogant fool, but falls for him later after seeing his more caring side with the patients.
When they start going out, Nina reveals burn scarring over a large portion of her stomach.
While Nina and George eventually fall in love, George struggles with having another person in his life he can potentially hurt and tries to distance himself several times.
However, their fates become entwined permanently in the series 1 finale, when George inadvertently scratches Nina during a transformation, passing the werewolf curse onto her as well.
Nina and George go through tough times during the first episode in season 2, which concludes with Nina revealing her scratch marks to George and that she is now a werewolf as well, during an argument.
In episode 2 Nina and George try to make things work, but Nina leaves George upon discovering that he helped a vampire who killed his own lover escape the country, subsequently being contacted by the mysterious Kemp and participating in research for a werewolf "cure" (Unaware that Kemp's experiment with a hyperbaric chamber would have killed her if it weren't for the intervention of Professor Lucy Jaggat).
While George and Mitchell are willing to be around Lucy after her true agenda is exposed, Nina is furious that she was willing to lead them to their deaths and harboured an intense dislike for her.
She moves to Wales with George and Mitchell after Annie goes through the door.
At the start of Series Three (and during her first transformation at their new home at Honolulu Heights), Nina and George apparently have sex while in wolf form, despite George's belief that one of them would kill the other if they transformed in close proximity to each other.
After learning that she was pregnant as a result of her and George's intercourse while in wolf form, Nina admits that her mother abused her when she was a child, and was contemplating terminating the pregnancy both because she fears the consequences of two werewolves creating a child and because she is afraid of repeating her mother's treatment of her.
Although they have not yet been able to determine what the baby will look like when born, or if it will "inherit" the werewolf "gene", Nina has apparently kept the baby despite the stress of her first pregnant transformation, although it is unclear how this will work as her condition progresses.
When George and Nina arranged an ultrasound to examine their baby at the eight-week stage, the nurse carrying out the operation noted that Nina appeared to be sixteen weeks along.
George speculated that this was just the result of werewolves gestating faster than humans, much like conventional wolves.
Despite her preoccupation with her pregnancy, Nina remains involved in other events at and around Honolulu Heights.
She assists George in helping the permanently teenage vampire Adam, with the two briefly contemplating taking over responsibility for Adam after his parents' deaths from old age.
Adam ultimately departs to make his own way, wanting to explore his own independence without being a burden on them like he was on his parents.
Nina is also affected by the household's encounter with the zombie Sasha.
Her decision to keep the baby is cemented by Sasha's declaration that her only regret was missing so many moments in life because she was more focused on the present than the future.
Matters come to a head when she and George recognise and kidnap a revived but amnesiac Herrick when he's brought into the hospital.
She and Mitchell have a confrontation regarding Herrick's ultimate fate: when Herrick discovers Mitchell's "diary" of the Box Tunnel Murders, he shares this with Nina, who begins to turn against Mitchell and eventually betrays him to the police.
Mitchell in turn begins to suspect that Nina is the werewolf "prophesied" to kill him.
Following Mitchell's arrest, Nina is stabbed by the now-restored Herrick as a revenge on George.
While Herrick expresses a polite regret for his action (especially given that Nina was the only person in the house to show him kindness), he is hell-bent on making George suffer in the way that he did when George killed him.
Fortunately, Annie is able to convince the manipulative ghost Lia to help her save Nina and the baby after convincing Lia that revenge couldn't solve anything.
In between the events of Series Three and Four, Nina gave birth to a baby girl.
Shortly afterwards, she was killed in a revenge attack by the Barry vampire community.
As with the birth of her daughter, Nina's death occurred off screen.
==========
Thomas McNair (Michael Socha) is a young 21-year-old werewolf.
He first appears in Series Three, in which he is living a nomadic life in a camper van with his adopted father McNair.
Their lifestyles as itinerant vampire killers had left Thomas socially isolated and dreaming of making a family with "the pack" of werewolves which McNair had claimed exist somewhere.
Although Thomas had lived his life believing that he was McNair's son, born a werewolf (and that his mother had died during a vampire attack), Nina's subsequent examination of his blood revealed that he was actually the child of a random couple McNair had attacked during an early transformation in Cornwall.
McNair had subsequently taken him in out of conscience as he realised that he had "infected" the boy with the werewolf "contagion'.
Although he was briefly attracted to Nina, he pushed this aside after he learned the truth about the nature of the "wolf'.
Initially angry at McNair for lying to him about his past, the two appeared to reconcile after McNair and Mitchell rescued him, George and Nina from a cage-fight, although he seems to be more interested in making his own way.
Following McNair's death at the hands of Herrick, Thomas is once again orphaned.
Despite McNair's last wish being that Thomas does not carry on his adoptive father's feud against vampires, the grief-stricken Thomas pursues Herrick and Mitchell to avenge McNair's death, killing at least two vampires along the way, although he is prevented from taking full vengeance due to a Mexican stand-off involving a threat to George.
Subsequently, Tom has lingered in Barry and been welcomed into the Honolulu Heights community, where he tries to learn to live like a human, love like a human and fight like a human.
At the start of Series Four, it's revealed that Tom has not entirely put his nomadic life and his vampire-killing mission behind him, but that loneliness is driving him to seek a permanent home at Honolulu Heights while he also works in a cafe.
Following the death of George, Tom takes his place as Annie's best friend and helper, giving up his camper van to the renegade vampire Dewi who needs to escape from Barry.
Although he does not entirely trust new housemate Hal, keeping stakes available even after arranging for Hal to get a job in the cafe where he works to help Hal pay for his share at Honolulu Heights, they have formed the beginning of a tentative friendship through their mutual distaste at the exploitation of women in the modern media.
Tom has recently celebrated his twenty-first birthday, which — after some tension caused when murderous ghost Kirby convinced Tom that Hal and Annie were ignoring it when they were actually just unaware — Annie and Hal celebrated by preparing a cake for him.
He recently had his first relationship with another werewolf named Allison, but forcibly ended it when he became concerned about the more violent tendencies she was beginning to develop due to her time with him, telling her to return to her parents so that she could have a normal life as a human for the days of the month when she wasn't a werewolf.
Although the vampire Cutler attempted to manipulate Tom into putting himself into a position where he would attack innocent people in a club in werewolf form, Hal was able to evacuate the club before wolf-Tom could harm anyone.
With Eve dead and Annie having crossed over after they destroyed the Old Ones, Tom has taken it upon himself to work with new ghost Alex to help Hal "detox" from his recent relapse into blood, commenting to Hal that he won't stake the vampire as Hal is "[his] best mate".
After Hal has finished 'detoxing', Tom and Hal take new jobs at the Barry Grand Hotel- Tom noting that he had always wanted to work in a hotel-, the two generally making a good impression on their new employers.
==========
Henry "Hal" (or "Harry") Yorke (Damien Molony) is an English vampire first encountered at the start of Series Four.
He was born in the late 15th century to one of six prostitutes working in a brothel.
He has claimed that he didn't know which of the prostitutes was his mother, but loved them all nevertheless.
He was turned at the Battle of Orsha on 8 September 1514 by an army surgeon after being fatally wounded by an enemy soldier's lance.
He has since become a well-known and feared vampire in the intervening years, being a commander in the vampire/werewolf wars of the early 1910s; he participated in a ritual intended to bind and seal the Devil, but because he didn't use his own blood for the ritual, the Devil was merely trapped in a human form, retaining enough of his power to destroy the ghost and werewolves in the ritual.
He is named as "Lord Harry" in the episode 3 of series 4, having once been a high-ranking "Old One" (He apparently knew previous characters Daisy and Ivan before their deaths in series 2, although it is unclear if he knew other vampires encountered in the series).
Hal's own actions anticipate and echo those of Mitchell in his recent attempts to refrain from blood-drinking.
Since 1955, he has set up home in Southend with his two best friends, the werewolf Leo and the ghost Pearl (much as Mitchell set up home with George and Annie).
Hal has kept his life to a rigid structure and kept away from all other people: he refers to his household and their house in Southend as the "cage" to which he submits to keep both himself and the outside world safe.
By the start of Series Four, this arrangement has become threatened by Leo's passage into old age and ill-health (with the threat that he might not survive many more werewolf transformations).
As the only member of the trio who can pose as a normal human, Leo is the one who owns their property and their source of livelihood (a barber's shop).
Furthermore, his eventual death will result in Pearl's "fading" as she loses her physical home and "familiar" friends.
Overhearing a "message" on a radio, Leo is inspired to travel to the house to visit Eve, but although she fails to cure him, he is nevertheless content to pass on with Pearl after admitting his love for her, with Hal deciding — albeit reluctantly, given the personality clashes - to remain in the house with Tom and Annie as his new "support group".
Hal's character notes on the BBC 3 Being Human page state that "coming to Honolulu Heights is a huge disruption for Hal.
And he doesn’t cope well with disruption.
At first, Hal – the stand-offish, posh vampire – and Tom – the common, feral werewolf – find themselves at loggerheads, but once a mutual respect is gained, we see this odd couple become close."
Although their relationship is generally uncomfortable as Tom and Annie "force" him to start working in a cafe to support himself despite the disruption to his routine, Hal proves himself even after his status as an Old One is revealed when he stakes Fergus and various other vampires to help protect Eve.
Although he and Tom have come to form a tentative friendship, after an injury sustained when Tom's blood left a significantly sized burn on his upper arm, Hal has become concerned that he is the "burned man" prophesised to be Eve's nemesis.
Although he became the leader of the vampire conquest of the world in Eve's future, in the present created by Eve's future ghost interfering in the past Hal was redeemed and changed by his interaction with Tom and Annie, to the point where he not only rejected Cutler's attempts to lure him back onto the vampires' side, but actually helped to thwart Cutler's plan to demonise werewolves.
Although Hal was intimidated at the presence of ancient vampire Mr Snow, who confidently informed Hal that he would join the other vampires regardless, Tom and Alex — a new ghost who had been killed by Cutler as part of his plan to lure Hal back into the fold- were able to save him from the destruction of the other Old Ones, the two subsequently resolving to help Hal detox from blood once again and break him from the cycle of slipping back into his old urges.
After spending a month in detox, Hal recovers enough to be released, swearing on Eve's memory that he will allow Tom and Alex to stake him if he relapses.
He accidentally causes an accident when he scares a man named Ian Cram into running into a car after he sees Hal's fangs, but Hal's attempt to save his life by turning him into a vampire backfires when Cram escapes and kills his former co-workers before he is able to cope with his new thirst.
Cram (now calling himself "Crumb") is taken prisoner, but Hal is haunted by an encounter with Dominic Rook — head of a supernatural observation organization — where Rook offered Hal a fresh supply of blood if Hal took control of the vampires.
Hal and Tom are currently working in the Barry Grand Hotel, although Hal is unaware that one of the guests is the Devil's human host.
==========
Alex Millar (Kate Bracken) is a young woman who first appears in the series 4 episode "Puppy Love".
She is a determined tomboy, the only woman in a family otherwise consisting of her father and three younger brothers, since her mother walked out on the family when she was seventeen.
She wanted to be a concert pianist in life, and was generally a 'tomboy', rarely dressing in a feminine manner.
On holiday in Barry with her family (only one of whom has appeared onscreen so far), Alex encounters Hal at the cafe and becomes romantically involved with him.
She initially (and unintentionally) bewilders and intimidates Hal, who cannot understand her attitude and initially shakes her off when she attempts to flirt with him: but Alex remains sufficiently interested to return to the cafe and leave her number for him.
Tom impulsively invites Alex to join him, Hal and Allison for a double date at a museum.
During the date, Alex is led to believe that Hal's reticence is due to him having trouble adjusting after a prior relationship breakdown, and she assures Hal that she didn't expect anything long-term.
Hal is in fact fighting off the desire to feed from her, and runs away.
Tom and Allison convince him to go back, as he is simply running away from potential relationships.
Hal begins to cautiously date Alex, but (under Cutler's influence) begins to drink blood again: the resulting, more licentious change in his personality repels Alex, who rejects him.
While trailing Hal, Cutler's henchmen note and pursue Alex: she is captured and subsequently killed, fatally drained of blood as part of Cutler's plot to both seduce and punish Hal.
Although Alex dies, she returns as a ghost.
She berates Hal for his unwitting role in her death, but still opts to help him to save Tom and the other victims of Cutler's broader plotting, and to subsequently fight against the Old Ones.
She goes on to rescue Hal from the explosion which eventually destroys the other Old Ones.
During this period, Alex's corpse is removed and hidden by a mysterious clean-up team led by Mr Rook.
At the end of Series 4, Alex has taken the departed Annie's place at Honolulu Heights, becoming the new ghost in the tripartite vampire/werewolf/ghost equation with Tom and Hal (echoing the previous Mitchell/George/Annie and Hal/Leo/Pearl relationships).
She is shown helping Tom restrain Hal so that they can break him from the cycle that he has trapped himself in of resisting and succumbing to his urge for blood.
While Kate Bracken's return as Alex was not stated by the BBC in press releases concerning Series 5, she stated in an interview that she would indeed be returning.
Although Alex initially assumed that her unfinished business was to recover her body and return it to her family, she is shocked to learn that her family had already buried her, leaving her confused at her continued existence on Earth.
She continues to struggle with her ghostly heritage, occasionally trying and failing to eat despite failed past attempts.
==========
Dominic Rook (Steven Robertson) is the leader of a British government department initially identified as "the Men in Grey" or as "the clean-up team".
The official name of the department has been revealed as "Department of Domestic Defence" (DoDD), it has existed since the time of Oliver Cromwell and carries out an extensive cover-up of the existence of supernatural creatures.
Rook has stated in dialogue that it is not run by supernatural creatures and that few such creatures even suspect its existence; and that it is perhaps best described as the "domestic staff" of the world, ensuring that the rest of the world's people "sleep soundly."
Rook has also suggested (or threatened) that people like him are "magicians", able to make people "disappear in a puff of smoke."
Rook is profoundly attached to his job, to the point at which he sees it as his entire life.
He is ruthless in both carrying out his tasks and defending his profession.
Rook first appears approximately halfway through the final episode of Series 4 ("The War Child") when he is briefly seen as the leader of a clean-up team which covertly enters Cutler's nightclub in Barry and removes Alex's mutilated corpse.
It is clear that he has led many such operations before as he and his team confidently work within a forty-five second operational time limit.
Rook appears again in the closing minutes of the episode when he is seen intimidating a woman who'd witnessed Tom's appearance in werewolf form at the Barry nightclub.
Via intimated threats, he compels her to keep her silence and surrender her recorded evidence.
He subsequently brings the latter to a staffed storage bunker concealed in woodland, in which vast amounts of such evidence (such as that remaining at the Kemp/Jaggatt facility from Series 2) is logged and concealed.
Rook and the Men in Grey play a more prominent role in Series 5, when they fall victim to government budget cuts which will close the department within three months.
Distraught by the news, Rook is driven to increasingly desperate measures and moral compromise in order to save the Men in Grey and his own life's work.
Having captured Hetty (the only other surviving vampire Old One), he learned of Hal's existence, and contacted him.
Rook offered to aid Hal in his blood addiction by providing him with a controlled supply of blood, in exchange for Hal taking control of the vampires and steering them towards a workable situation living alongside human beings.
Hal rejected the offer, but remained in contact with Rook, whose services he enlisted in containing the recently turned vampire Crumb.
While not a priority, Rook was also aware of the suspicious circumstances surrounding a series of suicides at the Barry Grand Hotel.
Knowing that Hal and Tom are working at the hotel, he asked Hal to monitor the situation there, and report back to him.
Manipulated by Captain Hatch, a resident of Barry Grand and the Devil incarnate, Rook attempted to stage a massacre at the hotel.
However, this plan was averted when Tom and Hal were able to contain Bobby, the werewolf Rook had released.
Simultaneously, Rook dispatched Hal to contain the released Crumb and his convert, Alan.
This plan also failed when Crumb staked Alan and committed suicide.
Prior to the events of the series, Rook rescued and recruited Natasha, a child captured by vampires.
He later tasked her with infiltrating the Barry Grand Hotel, and from there, Honolulu Heights.
Natasha began a relationship with Tom, whilst providing her blood as a way of sating Hal's lust.
Through this, she manipulated the two into a feud.
When Natasha began to doubt Rook's leadership and cause, Hatch manipulated her into committing suicide in front of Hal.

==========
William Herrick (Jason Watkins) is the powerful vampire "king", who "recruited" Mitchell during World War I.
In the first series, he is the leader of the Bristol vampire community, but is also putting into place a Final Solution-style movement in which the human population of the world would either be turned into vampires or farmed for blood.
To blend in with the human population, he works as a police sergeant, and his vampire coven operate under the auspices of a funeral parlour.
His cold, calculating personality is a stark contrast to Mitchell's compassionate character, and he often finds Mitchell's struggle to control his bloodlust and to blend in with humanity both amusing and offensive.
Before Herrick is able to fully execute his plans, however, George tricks him into agreeing to a showdown with Mitchell.
In actuality, George manages to get Herrick alone with him in a small room during a full moon.
George then transforms into his werewolf form (in which he was far physically stronger than a vampire) and kills Herrick by decapitating him.
Herrick appeared in a flashback in Series Two during a visit he and Mitchell made to London in 1969, during which he revealed that there is a similar system in London to the one which exists in Bristol, but he doesn't get along with the head vampire in London – the vampire's identity was never named – because he killed the vampire's mother under unrevealed circumstances.
In the Series Two finale, Herrick was resurrected by Daisy and Cara after they slit their wrists over his grave.
Herrick returned in the fifth episode of Series Three, apparently traumatised by what he experienced while dead, as he is seen in a hospital in a straitjacket, showing terror when Mitchell attacks him and confused when he realises that he cannot see his reflection in a mirror.
Despite his apparent personality changes, such as his attempt to console George over his fears about becoming a father, his expressed disdain for Annie's goodness, coupled with him directing Nina to a scrapbook of Mitchell's past murders, suggests that some part of him remains underneath his amnesia.
Mitchell has agreed to spare Herrick on George's request, but is also determined to discover the secret of Herrick's resurrection so that he can use it to escape his apparently prophesied demise.
Mitchell's attempts to restore Herrick's memory met with failure; although Mitchell speculated that human blood would restore Herrick's memory, he is naturally reluctant to go that far himself, while Herrick displayed an apparent discomfort at the idea of drinking from police detective Nancy Reed when she came to question Mitchell based on an anonymous tip about the Box Tunnel 20, although he was clearly tempted to do so despite his amnesia.
Herrick was partially restored to himself after killing the werewolf McNair (who attempted to kill Herrick because McNair had become infected with lycanthropy when Herrick put him in a cage to fight a werewolf) and made a full return to awareness and memory when he drank Nancy after she led the police team to arrest Mitchell.
He subsequently slaughtered the rest of the police team in the house, and then captured Nina on her return alone to the house.
Despite expressing "a dilemma" over whether to kill Nina in order to pay George back for killing him, or to let her live due to her kindness to him, Herrick chose to stab her (commenting that if he didn't "people would think I've gone soft...").
He dies at the end of series 3 (The wolf-shaped bullet) by getting staked by Mitchell while he is distracted by a sunrise.
Lauren Drake (Annabel Scholey) was a vampire turned by Mitchell in the pilot episode, who once worked as a nurse at the hospital.
Abandoned by Mitchell after being turned, Herrick took her under his wing, and while she resented what Mitchell has done to her, she also revelled in the vampire culture.
Mitchell attempted unsuccessfully to convince her to give up drinking blood, but she aided Mitchell and his friends in escaping the vampire headquarters.
Once safe, she pleads with Mitchell to kill her with a stake through the heart, which Mitchell does reluctantly.
Seth (Dylan Brown) was Herrick's primary henchman.
He and Mitchell were rivals in the first series, as Seth was the one who was caught beating up George on the night that he and Mitchell met.
Seth was seen as more impulsive and sarcastic than Herrick, although he did fall in line when the situation called for it.
In episode 5 of the first series, he was killed by Lauren as Mitchell and his friends try to escape the vampire compound.
He is however, mentioned in the Finale of series 3 by Herrick, while reminding Mitchell about not revealing the existence of vampires ("Even Seth knew that – and he used to point at planes.")
Cara (Rebecca Cooper) first appeared in Series 1 as a hospital canteen worker.
She was recruited as a vampire by Herrick after he saw the advantage of having a vampire ally working in the hospital.
Despite her low intelligence and lack of discipline, she proved an enthusiastic recruit and played a role in furthering Herrick's plans in his (ultimately unsuccessful) attempts to win over or destroy Mitchell and to kill George.
She remained loosely attached to the vampire coven in Series 2, although she seems to have spent much of her time homeless.
Following Mitchell's accession to the "kingship" of the Bristol vampire community, she was the first of the vampires to break his edict against feeding.
He punished her by smashing out her fangs and locking her into an underground cave, claiming to the others that he had executed her for disobedience.
At the end of Series 2, she was released by Daisy in order to assist in the resurrection of Herrick – she and Daisy provided the blood required for the task.
She briefly returned in Series 3 (without Daisy), having tracked Mitchell and George to Barry and brought the amnesiac, dysfunctional Herrick with her in an attempt to seek their help in "restoring" him to his former power and awareness.
Utterly besotted by Herrick (and referring to herself as his 'dark bride'), she is heartbroken when Herrick both remains in his amnesiac state and cruelly rejects her.
In despair and humiliation, she commits suicide by staking herself.
Owen Norayan (Gregg Chillin) was the landlord of the property occupied by the three housemates, and Annie's ex-fiancé.
He was also the man who killed Annie by pushing her down the stairs after an argument.
After the murder, Owen immediately turned to his new girlfriend, Janey Harris, whom Owen had been having an affair with during his relationship with Annie.
After an unsuccessful attempt to haunt Owen and Janey, during which he attempted to mock her for her 'pathetic' hanging around, Annie later confronted him with George and Mitchell, revealing their true nature and telling Owen a secret about what happens upon someone's death.
This secret, which was unheard by the viewer, drove Owen mad with fear and compelled him to confess his crime to the police so that he can be kept safe from 'them'.
Owen is currently incarcerated in an asylum, although his information allowed Kemp to identify Mitchell, George and Annie as their true natures.
Josie Hunter (Clare Higgins old Josie, Charlene McKenna young Josie) was a former girlfriend of Mitchell's during the 1960s.
Though diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, she resisted Mitchell's attempts to recruit her for Herrick's movement and warned him of Herrick's plans, later sacrificing herself to give Mitchell her blood so that he could heal after an attack from Herrick.
Her original meeting with Mitchell was revealed in a flashback in Series 2, where she helped to shelter Mitchell when he tried to escape the police after he and Herrick killed several girls in a London flat.
==========
 Lee Tully (Dean Lennox Kelly) is a werewolf who encountered George during Series One and offered to mentor him through his condition.
He is much more comfortable with being a werewolf than George, and a combination of his "seize-the-day" outlook and clever advice on handling the condition won George's trust (and, to a degree, hero-worship).
However, George pushed Tully away when he discovered that Tully was the werewolf originally responsible for George's own condition, and was only trying to befriend George to combat his own loneliness.
Following his rejection by George, Tully left the area and he wasn't heard from until the season 2 finale when – in Kemp's facility – George and Nina notice some writing in a holding cell stating "George, all the werewolves die" signed Tully, indicating Tully encountered and died at the hands of Jaggat's 'cure'.
His first name is revealed to be Lee, as Lucy names him as one of the four who died in the chamber.
Gilbert (Alex Price) is a ghost who George and Mitchell introduce Annie to in Series One.
Having died in the 1980s, he attempts to help Annie resolve her death.
However, this leads to Annie's discovery of the circumstances of her death.
Eventually he discovers his own reason for being a ghost: he needed to learn to love.
And as he has fallen in love with Annie, his door appears.
He smiles as he walks through it, seeing a pale, bluish welcoming light emanating from it.
Gilbert would either have a cigarette tucked behind his ear, or he would be smoking it.
He also enjoyed 1980's music, which he listened to on his portable cassette player, and he even makes a mix tape for Annie.
Annie mentioned him in the last episode of Season Three, when she suggested that Lia -another ghost she met in Purgatory – look for Gilbert for company.
Janey Harris (Sama Goldie) was Owen's girlfriend and fiancée after Annie was murdered.
She owns a nearby tanning salon, and Annie often seethed at her "orange" appearance along with her shallow and somewhat dense personality.
After discovering how she had died, Annie attempted to warn Janey of Owen's violent side, but was thwarted when Owen discovered the two of them and dismissed Annie's presence as a figment of Janey's guilty conscience (for their affair while Annie was still alive).
Bernie (Mykola Allen) was a schoolboy who lived in the neighbourhood.
After Mitchell scared away a group of kids who were bullying Bernie, the two became friends, and Mitchell became something of a father figure to Bernie.
Unfortunately, a turn of events involving a vampire porn/snuff film DVD caused both Mitchell and George to be accused of pædophilia by Bernie's mother, Fleur, and for the two of them to be ostracised and persecuted by the neighbourhood.
This blew up into a riot during which Bernie was hit by a car and rendered comatose.
With Fleur's consent and knowledge, Mitchell turned Bernie into a vampire to save his life, but was racked with guilt about condemning the boy to the life of a vampire.
Both Bernie and Fleur have moved away and their whereabouts are unknown.
Becca (Jessica Harris) works with Mitchell and George at the hospital.
George likes Becca but she is mainly interested in Mitchell.
When Becca and Mitchell go out on a date Becca is being attacked by the vampire Lauren.
Since Becca is dying George asks Mitchell to turn her into a vampire.
Mitchell refuses, because he has seen what has become of Lauren after he had turned her.
==========
Kemp (Donald Sumpter) is a member of the secretive organisation pursuing supernaturals in Series 2 (although technically he first appears in the closing moments of the last episode of Series 1).
He is Lloyd's superior though not the organisation's leader.
He is a religious zealot who appears to have his own agenda as regards supernaturals, whom he thinks should be removed from society.
Following Professor Jaggat's instructions, Kemp allows Mitchell, George and Annie to be left alone simply to study the consequences of the three 'types' interacting with each other on a long-term basis.
Although he claimed to want to help a werewolf develop a cure for his 'condition' by putting him in a hyperbaric chamber to cancel out the pressure caused by the moon, when the treatment began to prove dangerous to the werewolf Kemp allowed it to continue, and implies that he has seen similar 'accidents' in his time.
In a flashback it was revealed that Kemp was an Anglican priest whose wife and young daughter were killed by a trio of vampires thirty years ago, which is what motivates his mission.
Even to this day he still carries the blood soaked Bible he used to defend himself on the night he discovered what became of his family.
He is clearly defined by his prejudices, believing that werewolves are possession by a demonic force rather than an 'infection'.
He has also commented (on one occasion) that he believes Mitchell "seduced" George to explain their friendship, rather than believing that Mitchell could genuinely form a platonic friendship with another being.
In Episode Eight, he went so far as to kill a psychic that had been working with the group in order to create a Door so that he could forcibly exorcise Annie, only for Mitchell to spare his life when George argued that killing him for Annie would be killing him for the wrong reasons.
He subsequently tracked down Mitchell, George and Nina to try to kill them, even killing Lucy after she unintentionally led him to their new home, only for him to be forcibly dragged through the Door by Annie despite his still-living status.
Professor Lucy Jaggat (Lyndsey Marshal) is the chief scientist working for the mysterious organisation pursuing supernatural entities in Series 2.
Professor Jaggat is first mentioned by Kemp in the final episode of the first series, and is constantly referred to by both Kemp and Lloyd in the first two episodes of the second series.
At the end of episode 3 Professor Jaggat is revealed to be Lucy, a doctor who has recently moved to Bristol and who has been forging a close relationship with Mitchell since episode 1 of Series 2.
Despite Kemp's own prejudices against the supernatural, Lucy appears to be more willing to treat them as humans, believing Mitchell's claims that he is trying to go clean from blood- although he initially didn't explicitly reveal his vampire status to her, simply saying that he is trying to get past something- and normalising the pressure in the hyperbaric chamber when Nina is inside to save her life.
When Mitchell finally revealed his true identity to her, the two actually slept together.
Lucy's subsequent guilt about the liaison drove her to contact Kemp and reveal the location of a vampire stronghold, allowing Kemp to kill over thirty vampires with a bomb.
Her betrayal left Mitchell disgusted with humanity, and sent him on a bloody rampage.
In the Series Two finale, Mitchell was about to kill her, when Kemp dragged Annie through the door, and she was sent to the afterlife.
Presumably he felt a painful reaction at her leaving (due to the fact he'd gotten so attached to her) and crumpled to the floor in pain, crawling away from Lucy and towards Kemp.
Lucy is last seen at the very end of the series, walking up to Mitchell in the street.
She attempts to apologise, but Mitchell refuses, distraught at the loss of Annie- he blames her partly for what happened, calling her a monster.
He does however let her stay.
George wakes in the night to hear Lucy scream- and he finds she'd been killed by Kemp, who had presumably gone mad (or even madder than he had been to begin with).
Annie comes back from the door to drag Kemp back in with her, stopping him from killing Mitchell, Nina and George.
Ivan (Paul Rhys) is a 237-year-old vampire who (together with his consort Daisy) travels the world as a war tourist.
It is this pursuit that has brought him to Bristol to witness the aftermath of William Herrick's death.
He made his debut on the show in the first episode of Series 2.
Ivan is jaded by his long existence as a vampire, and has displayed a detached curiosity about human feelings, having lost his own almost entirely, he is also known to have a dark sense of humour.
Although he agreed to serve as the 'poster-boy' for Mitchell's 'anti-blood' group, he has admitted that he cannot forsake his centuries of 'servitude' to the hunger, forcing Mitchell to allow him to feed in private in order to maintain his image for the group.
In episode 6 of series 2, Ivan is apparently killed when the vampires' base is blown up, but he manages to save Mitchell's life by shielding him from the brunt of the explosion.
He and Daisy apparently encountered former Old One Hal at one point, as Hal compared a new vampire couple to Ivan and Daisy.
Daisy Hannigan-Spiteri (Amy Manson) is Ivan's consort, originally a young Scottish woman whom he met in an air raid shelter during World War II and persuaded to come with him on a life of adventure, leaving her baby daughter behind (Ivan presumably turned Daisy into a vampire shortly afterwards.)
Daisy joined Ivan on his war tourism for the next 60-odd years.
In a prequel to Series 2 placed by the BBC on YouTube entitled "Ivan & Daisy", she persuaded Ivan to take her to Bristol and indulge their appetite for visiting hot-spots by witnessing the aftermath of William Herrick's death.
An additional (and secret) motive for their trip to Bristol was so that she could visit and murder her ageing daughter (which Daisy referred to as "the last thread" keeping her attached to her former life).
Daisy seduced George in episode 1 of Series 2 and their paths have continued to cross.
George, in turn, persuaded her not to murder her daughter by re-awakening Daisy's human feelings and sense of guilt over her She returns in episode 7 of series 2, distraught over the death of Ivan.
She accompanies Mitchell in trying to find out the instigator behind the explosion that killed Ivan and numerous other vampires.
When Mitchell discovers that Lucy, his lover from previous episodes, was involved, the two vampires go on a feeding frenzy on a railway train, savaging an entire carriage (known as the "Box Tunnel twenty massacre").
The two are then seen in bed together, covered in blood.
Mitchell apparently left her to rescue George, Nina and Annie.
Daisy then opted to resurrect Herrick, rescuing fellow vampire Cara from incarceration in order to carry out the necessary blood rite.
Although Cara remained with Herrick, McNair told Herrick that he had killed Daisy, showing one of her teeth as proof.
Lloyd Pinky (credited as simply Technician in the second series) (Mark Fleischmann) is a technician working for the mysterious organisation that seeks to study and experiment on supernaturals.
He also runs the Centre for the Study of Supernatural Activity (or CenSSA) website which forms part of a viral campaign for Series 2.
It is not altogether clear whether CenSSA and the mysterious organisation he works for on the show are one and the same.
On the website in a video posted on Monday 18 January 2010 he refers to his colleagues in the mysterious organisation as "the Bible boys downstairs".
Sam Danson (Lucy Gaskell) is a woman who met George following his initial break-up with Nina, while he was teaching at the language college where she worked as a secretary.
Sam is a single parent, living with her daughter Molly in Sam's mother's flat.
She and George became attracted to each other and began a whirlwind romance.
Increasingly desperate and determined to lead a normal human life (and still on the rebound from Nina), George rapidly escalated the relationship to the point where he, Sam and Molly moved into a new house together.
Soon afterwards, he proposed marriage but Sam preferred to defer it until later.
George's attempts to conceal his werewolf nature from Sam, and to protect his new family from it, led him into lying to her.
When he made a mistake over daylight saving time (failing to plan properly for his transformation at moonrise), he began to transform in front of her before fleeing.
Although George managed to conceal the full truth of his condition from Sam (managing to persuade her that at least part of it was "anger management issues") he came to realise that his attempts to lead a normal life with her were doomed, and ended the relationship.
Molly Danson (played by child actress Molly Jones) is Sam's young pre-teen daughter.
Cynical, toughened and very intelligent (she is quite capable of researching information and laying traps for liars), she is suspicious of any of Sam's boyfriends and does her best to reject and intimidate them.
Despite this, George eventually manages to persuade her to warm to him.
The relationship becomes strained when Molly discovers that George has been lying to Sam, although she is sufficiently accepting of George to warn him against lying rather than turning Sam against him.
Molly appears to have some degree of psychic sensitivity, as she dreams about George being "not George", although she doesn't realise the entire truth about him.
It is at Molly's school that George's life with Molly and Sam is destroyed, when George begins to transform unexpectedly during a parent's evening.
During his escape from the building, Molly sees him during the early stages of transformation (with changed eyes, teeth and claws) and is terrified.
Although she does not explain her terror to her mother, she retains it on George's return to their house, leading him to realise that he can no longer conceal his werewolf nature and therefore cannot continue to be part of their family.
Though heartbroken, George clearly bears no grudges against Molly for her part in the situation, referring to both Sam and Molly as "wonderful" before he leaves.
Saul (Alex Lanipekun) is a real-estate agent who entered into the corner pub while Annie was practising her job as a bartender in episodes 1 and 2 of Series 2.
Striking up a friendship, Saul doesn't initially confide to her a prior car accident which rendered him clinically dead for six minutes but left him sensitive to the presence and communication of evil spirits; after being pressured by them to explain the incident to her, he invites her to his flat where he is then goaded by a spirit utilising the form of a television news anchor to commit sexual assault, at which point Annie disappears.
Distraught, Saul is then encouraged to drink and drive under the influence, leading to a car crash in which he is brutally injured.
Annie, however, is present when Saul dies and appears out of body, just in time for the "door" to appear in the hospital room; Annie then realises that the spirits (now urging Saul through a nearby radio) are guiding him to drag Annie kicking and screaming to the afterlife, at which point she violently resists his attempted abduction until Saul finally seizes control of himself enough to drop her before the door separates them for eternity.
Annie then realises that the spirits in the afterlife are desperate to use any means to bring her beyond the door, even those who are sensitive to spirits and who may genuinely love her.
Hugh (Nathan Wright) is the owner of the corner pub at which Annie temporarily worked in episodes 1 and 2.
He finds Annie quirky as a bartender, but eventually develops a strong, but private interest in her (and a rivalry with Saul).
He eventually shows up at the main characters' flat after Annie was sexually assaulted (under duress) by Saul, where he confesses his love for her, but then he decides that he did not want to fall in love with her so soon after Annie's "breakup", and they instead commit to taking time as friends (and when she decides to initiate a kiss).
This love is short-lived by way of Annie being deprived of her visibility after Saul was goaded to attempt to drag her into the afterlife.
Annie and George allow Hugh a certain amount of closure later on, by reuniting him with his former lover, who had been working as a florist since their regretful break-up some time previous.
Sykes (Bryan Dick) is an experienced ghost from World War Two who teaches ghosts' skills to Annie to allow her to thwart the Gatekeepers.
Having been a ghost for 60 years, Sykes has developed his powers extensively, being able to read auras, read minds and show greater control over technology than Annie.
Sykes is a ghost due to his reluctance to meet his ex-comrades in the afterlife, who he fears will punish him due to failing them and causing their deaths.
Sykes was a Royal Air Force corporal when he died and still wears the uniform.
==========
Hennessey (Adrian Schiller) is a psychic who works with Kemp's organization.
He is first seen as a convict going along with Kemp to test any supernatural presence in the flat.
He later acts as a medium between Annie and Kemp in the initial attempt to allow Annie to pass on which was interrupted by one of George's oncoming transformations.
He resides in Kemp's facility following Annie moving there and shares a room with her, apparently befriending by her.
When Kemp tries to forcibly exorcise Annie, Hennessey stands up for her and points out the lack of the Door, causing Kemp to kill him for one.
After seeing his own dead body on the floor and Annie for the first time, his Door appears and they are both forcefully dragged in.
Hennessey displayed far greater control over his ability than other psychics.
Aside from hearing ghosts, he was able to sense the residue of Annie's presence in her home (and distinguishing it from her actually being present at the time) and he had showed that he could determine her exact location by focusing his ability.
Alan Cortez (Simon Paisley Day) is a stage psychic that Annie befriended when she stumbled upon his show.
Believing at first he is a fraud, Anne soon discovered he was an actual psychic only with a damaged ability.
Alan explained that his ability had manifested itself around puberty, but he couldn't control it and it wrecked much of his youth because people thought he was mentally ill.
He eventually became a stage performer, using his ability to help ghosts though he felt bitter about it at the time as he felt his ability had taken over his life.
One day he had an accident on stage injuring his head and damaging his ability to hear most ghosts (he could communicate with Annie due to her strong presence).
Annie asks him why he doesn't just quit since he got what he wanted in the accident.
Alan admits the irony of the matter being that he came to see his ability as a part of him and he lost a part of himself when it went away.
With Annie's help he is able to help the numerous ghosts that have been following him for weeks since he came to town.
At the end of the episode he reveals to Annie that (most likely thanks to being around her) his ability is starting to heal itself and he is starting to hear the ghosts again.
Hetty (Madeleine Harris) is one of the vampire elders (or Old Ones).
Recruited at a very young age, she appears to be an 8 or 9-year-old girl but as of 2010 is 462 years old.
She initially appears in a promotional webisode for Series 2, in which she converses with Ivan and Daisy in a Singapore restaurant prior to her departure to join the other old ones in Bolivia.
Hetty was originally responsible for recruiting Herrick as a vampire, and expresses disappointment that he was killed in such an "undignified" manner.
This is expanded on in a scripted but never filmed webisode for Series 3 set in 1890, in which Herrick (then a crooked lawyer, and unaware of Hetty's nature) attempts to sell her to a brothel as a child prostitute following the death of her father: instead she attacks and feeds on him, and recruits him into the vampire species.
Hetty reappears in Series 4, when she travels to Britain with the other Old Ones.
She is initially mentioned in one of the episode cold opens (set in 1855) in which Fergus states that Hal and Hetty know each other and that Hetty was one of the Old Ones who fears him.
Hetty is subsequently seen in the group of Old Ones who appear in the penultimate episode of Series 4 and are killed by Annie's bomb: she escapes the building before the explosion.
She later reappears in the opening episode of Series 5 ("The Trinity") as a captive of Dominic Rook and the Men in Grey.
In this episode, she agrees to tell Rook everything she knows about Hal (now the only other surviving Old One) in exchange for being flown back secretly to Bolivia.
Carl (Steve John Shepherd) is a gay vampire and a friend of Mitchell.
They shared a flat together.
Carl helped Mitchell to get clean from blood in 2000 and hasn't drunken blood for more than 20 years.
When Carl accidentally kills his boyfriend Dan Mitchell helps Carl to escape from the police.
Carl travels to Brasil.
In Brasil he gets a new boyfriend, who is a werewolf.
They want to travel back to the UK.
Rufus and his mother Kathleen (Sara Pascoe) are sent to Annie by Sykes.
Rufus is a ghost baby and Kathleen his ghost mother.
They both died because of a leaky boiler.
Sykes told Kathleen that Annie would take care of Rufus, while Kathleen is dating a ghost firemen.
Annie loves Rufus and doesn't want him to leave.
Trevor is a goldfish.
Mitchell buys him and gives him to Lucy Jaggat.
Mitchell fancies Lucy and she told him that she lost her own goldfish which she loved very much.
As Mitchell wants to have a date with Lucy he asks her if he can visit Trevor.
Lucy however tells him that she has just broken up with her boyfriend, so she doesn't want to meet another man.
She also says that she appreciates the gesture and takes Trevor home.
==========
Lia Shaman (Lacey Turner) is a dead person who leads Mitchell on his journey through Purgatory to rescue Annie.
It turns out that she is one of the victims of Mitchell's killing spree on a public train, being one of the twenty people he and Daisy killed on his rampage (known as the "Box Tunnel twenty massacre").
The revelation of her identity forces Mitchell to admit that he still sees himself as a monster even as he tries to get past what he once was.
Lia also reveals that Mitchell's time and date of death has been confirmed, and he will apparently be killed by a werewolf at some not-too-distant future date, commenting that this knowledge is an apt punishment for his past sins.
Although Lia appeared to be manipulating Mitchell's life from Purgatory, she later admitted that she had actually made up the story about a 'wolf-shaped bullet' to play with Mitchell's mind, intending for the 'prophecy' to drive a wedge between Mitchell, George and Nina, only for the plan to backfire when Mitchell suspected McNair and Tom instead.
Lia attempted to trap Annie in Purgatory to further punish Mitchell, but she was convinced to release her when Annie forced her to recognise how out of her depth she was.
Anthony Michael McNair (Robson Green), generally known simply as "McNair", is a werewolf and self-appointed vampire hunter.
Fifteen years ago, McNair was a surveyor.
One night, vampires abducted him and forced him to cage fight with a werewolf called Alan (It was later revealed that the vampires included Herrick).
Although McNair won, he was exposed to the werewolf pathogen and turned as a result of its aftermath.
He has since dedicated himself to a life as a nomadic vampire killer, and lives in a camper van with his 'adopted' adolescent son, Thomas.
Despite McNair's anti-vampire prejudices, he has reached something of an accommodation with Mitchell following the latter's help in his rescuing of George, Nina and Thomas from a later vampire cage-fight: in the midst of the resulting pitched battle, the feral McNair even deliberately passed over Mitchell to attack another vampire.
He and Mitchell now exist as civil enemies under an unstated truce.
McNair, however, made it clear that he still believes that Mitchell will get his punishment at some point in the future.
Having injured his leg, McNair returned to the house for the next full moon.
Having detected the scent of the amnesiac Herrick in the upstairs attic, he went up in time to confront Herrick during his transformation.
In the resulting struggle, Herrick stabbed McNair to death on instinct, in the process regaining at least some of his old drives and memories.
In a letter written to Thomas and read posthumously, McNair expresses some remorse that his drive for vengeance has shaped his life and made him ruthless, and urges his adopted son not to continue the feud against vampires following his death.
Adam Jacobs (Craig Roberts) is a vampire.
Turned at the age of 16, he is actually 46 years old when he first appears, although he maintains a teenage appearance and perspective.
Following his turning, his parents provided him with blood in order to protect both him and their neighbours.
Eventually both of Adam's parents aged and died, with his father spending his final days in the Barry hospital in which George and Nina work.
Having caught Adam while he tried to feed from his father, George and Nina attempted to take him to Mitchell for training.
Mitchell was reluctant to take on more responsibility as he himself was continuing to struggle with his own thirst.
Instead, he arranged for Adam to stay with Richard and Emma, a seemingly middle-aged vampire couple who apparently had "a system" in place to enable them to live safely and not pose a threat to society.
George and Nina returned to get him back when they realised that Richard and Emma were essentially perverts, their 'system' consisting of a BDSM-esque party where the humans allowed themselves to be drunk from.
Despite the comfort that the vampires could offer him, Adam rejected the vampires' way of life, bluntly informing them that they were all perverts.
Although George was willing to take on the responsibility, Adam recognised that he couldn't force them to cope with him like his parents had, deciding to make his own way in the world so that he could find out whether or not he would be dangerous on his own.
After Mitchell advised him to find good people to share his life with so that they could keep him under control by 'inspiring' him with the disappointment they would feel, Adam decided to depart on the next train out of the city to see where it took him, demonstrating a marked improvement when he rejected a girl he had initially attempted to drain when she offered to go with him.
In the spin-off "Becoming Human", Adam formed his own small 'group' at his new school in the form of recently turned werewolf Christa and recently murdered ghost Matt, the three teaming up to investigate Matt's murder.
He returned in Season Four in a relationship with Yvonne, the headmistress of a girls' school where Adam had been 'hunting'; although the relationship was complicated when it was discovered that Yvonne was a succubus who could seduce and kill men- Adam only having survived the relationship because he was already dead-, Annie helped Adam realise that he still cared about her anyway.
Detective Nancy Reed (Erin Richards) is a young detective- nicknamed 'Nancy Drew' by her colleagues, much to her frustration- involved in the investigation of the Box Tunnel 20 massacre.
She responded to an anonymous tip (from Nina) to talk with Mitchell about the massacre, but left empty-handed.
After Annie followed Nancy back to the station and saw a photograph of Lia as one of the victims, she convinced Mitchell to tell Nancy about Daisy, but Mitchell was still only able to provide limited information due to her vampire status.
While Nancy was cleaning up, she was confronted by Herrick, who showed her the newspaper clipping 'diary' of Mitchell's past exploits, but Mitchell took it from her before she could leave.
During her subsequent investigation, she managed to acquire a fingerprint from Mitchell which she took to the police pathologist Cooper.
Cooper positively identified it as being identical to those found in the Box Tunnel 20 carriage, but at the same time revealed himself as a vampire working within the police force to protect Mitchell and other vampires.
Cooper knocked Nancy out, but was then staked by Annie.
Nancy subsequently led the police raid which arrested Mitchell, only to be killed by an enraged and bloodthirsty Herrick when he succumbed to his vampiric instincts.
==========
Sasha (Alexandra Roach): During the third episode of Season Three, Annie encounters Sasha, a foul-mouthed, drunken and visibly deteriorating young woman.
Sasha turns out to be a "Type Four" or zombie, the first such being sighted in the Being Human fictional universe.
She develops a problematic crush on Mitchell, initially displaying ignorance of her true condition or the circumstances of what had happened to her (Although she admitted later that she was actually fully aware of what had happened to her and was simply denying the truth, commenting that she could feel herself rotting).
The group learn that they are indirectly responsible for Sasha's condition when Mitchell and Annie learn that she and at least four others came back at approximately the same time that Mitchell crossed over to the other side to recover Annie.
When Sasha attempts to reunite with her boyfriend, Gethin, he stabs her through the chest with a trophy in a panic, revealing that she can be injured but cannot heal.
Annie attempted to make Sasha feel better with a makeover- allowing Sasha to look reasonably human- and a night out, but her body began to collapse as they were out dancing at a club, Nina speculating that whatever force reanimated her body was simply losing the ability to keep itself together when 'competing' with her decay.
As she lay dying, Sasha sadly reflected that her only regret was not doing more with her life, resulting in her missing out on chances like having more time partying or convincing her boyfriend to let them start a family, asking Nina and Annie not to forget that.
Noting that she was grateful to have real friends with her at her end, Sasha passed on at last, her last words being to tell Annie to "seize the day".
Graham (Tony Maudsley) is an alleged vampire fan of Mitchell's, who came to the hospital to learn from his 'hero', deliberately dressing and styling his hair to match Mitchell despite being significantly overweight.
Although he initially tried to subtly blackmail Mitchell to let him stay by threatening to reveal his role in the Box Tunnel 20 massacre to Annie, Mitchell eventually threw him out when he began to flirt with her, denouncing Graham as a pathetic wannabe with no friends or personality of his own.
Attempting to get revenge, Graham set out to stage his own train massacre, resolving to be the new vampire 'legend'.
Although slightly sorry for Graham after he admitted that he killed his own children after his transformation, Mitchell staked Graham in order to stop him hurting anyone else, Graham's last words being to ask Mitchell to tell people that he liked Graham to give him some kind of reputation.
George Sands, Senior (James Fleet) is George's father.
When growing up, George regarded his father as a boring but decent father, with no problems such as gambling or alcoholism to detract from his role as a father, but he lost touch with his son after George was turned into a werewolf.
His relationship with his wife subsequently became increasingly distant, to the point that she began to have an affair with George's old P.E.
teacher.
When Annie saw a notice in the paper about George Snr.
's death, George went home to attend the funeral, but saw what he believed was his father's 'ghost' at the funeral.
Learning that his father had apparently died in a fire in his shed, George told him about the Door to try to help him understand why he might still be staying around.
However, when George and Nina found George Snr.
eating crisps in his camper van, he revealed that he and a friend of his in the police had found the shed burnt to the ground with an unidentified, apparently homeless man inside it, George faking his death to try to get a new start, going along with the 'ghost' story to spend time with his son.
George and Nina were able to convince him to assert himself to regain his wife, George Snr.
subsequently punching his wife's lover after he insulted George and George Snr.
George Snr.
and his wife subsequently took the camper van on a trip to Cornwall to regain the spark in their marriage.
Ruth Sands (Marion Bailey) is the mother of George.
After George has left, she has started an affair with Georges former P.E.
teacher Marcus Logue.
George hates the teacher and wants his mother to get back with his father.
Edgar Wyndham (Lee Ingleby) is one of the "Old Ones", a caste of revered vampire elders who command the obedience of other vampires.
The "Old Ones" are based in South America after having left Europe sometime in the past to avoid detection.
Wyndham, who declares himself to be about 1,000 years old, is introduced towards the end of the last episode of series 3 posing as a senior police officer while he sorts out the problems caused by Mitchell's arrest that threatened to reveal the existence of vampires to mankind and put at risk vampire plans for the world.
He arrives at Honolulu Heights at the climax of the Series 3 finale, just in time to halt Mitchell's attempt to end his own life via staking at the hands of George.
Wyndham states that the vampires are now taking over the world and that the only reason that they are not taking action against George, Nina and Annie is his curiosity about Annie's potential for power and about the outcome of Nina's pregnancy.
He also states that he has plans for Mitchell and demands that the younger vampire comes with him, stating that he'll use Mitchell as an "attack dog" to kill others at his order and whim.
Mitchell is compelled to agree but at the last minute George, horrified at what this will mean for his friend, finally takes action and stakes Mitchell to save him from being used in that way.
Afterwards, George states to Wyndham "I think you'll have a fight on your hands."
Despite Wyndham's end-of-series establishment as a potential main antagonist, this was not developed further: at the start of Season 4 it's revealed that George killed him soon after killing Mitchell.
==========
Eve Sands (Gina Bramhill plus various infant performers) was the daughter of George and Nina.
As an infant, Eve was conceived while both of her parents were in wolf form and was therefore initially suspected to be the first werewolf to be born (rather than "made" via infection).
Events in "The Eve of the War", when she failed to transform at her first full moon, demonstrated that this was not the case and that she was apparently a normal human (albeit retaining some kind of supernatural ability as she is able to see Annie).
However, at the same time Eve was identified (by the vampire Regus) as the prophesied "War Child" who would at some point in the future destroy the vampire race.
With both of her parents dead, Eve's guardianship was taken over by Annie and her new companions Tom and Hal (with, for a while, some indirect backup from Regus).
During the duration of Series 4, the baby Eve lived under the threat of extermination from both the Barry vampires and the vampire Old Ones en route from South America.
She also appeared to be being stalked by the ghost of a young woman from the future.
The ghost in question (initially credited as "The Woman") was the ruthless former leader of a London-based human resistance movement during the time of vampire dominion over the world.
In the future, with the resistance gradually losing the battle, she had consulted stolen vampire lore and found out deeply troubling information about Eve's role as War Child.
In an attempt to destroy the War Child, she had herself killed in order to pass into Purgatory as a ghost.
Purgatory's coterminous existence with all times enabled her to access the past and mount a series of campaigns in order to destroy Eve in the present.
She attempted several methods including autosuggestion via radio and television (in the manner of Purgatory's Gatekeepers, as seen in Series 2) and sending another ghost (Kirby) back to the living world as an assassin.
The Woman's full identity and agenda — as well as the full nature of her knowledge regarding the War Child — was initially unrevealed, although she apparently knew a great deal about Eve's mother Nina and was therefore able to provide Kirby with enough private information for him to convince Annie that he had been sent by Nina to help them.
The Woman's true identity was revealed in "Puppy Love" and expanded upon in "Making History", when she revealed herself to Annie and addressed her as "Mum".
She was the adult version of Eve, attempting to destroy herself in an attempt to destroy the future which she lived in, and which had been formed due to the vampire prophecies/parchments about her; the Old One Mr.
Snow points out (episode 8) that their piece of the parchments state that Eve's death would prevent the Old One's plan to take over the world.
Snow tells Annie he will help Annie protect Eve, and speculates that Eve would allow the vampires to win because humans would be so busy looking to Eve to save them that they wouldn't rally themselves against the vampires until it was too late.
The adult Eve showed Annie what the future was like (a vampire tyranny in which all but the vampires were dead, dying or farmed for blood) and attempted to persuade Annie to avert the future by killing baby Eve herself.
Annie's love for the infant Eve made her reluctant to do this, or to abandon her role as protector.
Annie eventually caused Eve's death in the final episode of Series 4 ("The War Child") when her only remaining option was to trigger an explosion which destroyed the Old Ones and ended their plans for world conquest.
This explosion also killed baby Eve, proving that the parchments were correct in predicting "that Eve's death is the key to humanity's survival" (stated by Milo in episode 8) by killing the scheming Old Ones (though two are seen escaping first) without actually killing the world's 'average' vampires.
Eve's (and the Old Ones') death also concluded Annie's own "unfinished business" on Earth, finally allowing her to pass into the afterlife through her own Door.
Arriving there, Annie found baby Eve and also met the adult Eve one last time before the latter dissipated and vanished.
Before fading from existence, adult Eve thanked Annie and reassured her that the terrible future Eve had grown up into (and the person she'd been forced to become) had both now been erased.
Annie then took baby Eve through a further door within the afterlife, with a strong implication that Eve's parents (and Mitchell) were on the other side of it.
Nick Cutler (Andrew Gower) was a Barry-based vampire, .
A high-ranking member of the Barry vampire community, he worked as a lawyer and eventually replaced first Griffin and then Fergus as de facto leader, albeit presiding over a rapidly shrinking membership.
Cutler had a sarcastic and restless demeanour and a more modern outlook to the vampire 'world domination' initiative than most of his vampire peers, expressing frustration at their inability to learn from history and to make new plans.
Cutler was part of the initial plot to trick George out of Honolulu Heights and seize Eve, and survived the subsequent massacre.
His deviousness was shown in several areas: when the journalist Peter (seeking to prove the existence of vampires) trapped himself and Cutler in a hotel room with a cross painted on the inside door, Cutler escaped by killing Peter and using his body as a shield against the cross.
Cutler was recruited as a vampire in 1950 by Hal (at the time cruel, committed to evil and posing as a crime boss).
He was targeted as a replacement lawyer for the vampires following the death of their last one.
Cutler was reluctant to kill humans in the beginning, although he began to cooperate once he began craving blood to the point of addiction.
Some time after his turning, Hal demanded that Cutler kill his own wife in order to "shed his human life".
Following Cutler's refusal Hal secretly trapped and drained her himself, tricking Cutler into drinking her blood unknowingly, before showing him her body as a lesson.
The lesson must have worked as in the present Cutler has no problem manipulating or killing humans although he still feels guilt, confusion and anger at Hal for making him 'abandon his entire species'.
During the whole of Series 4, Cutler devised and put into action a vampire-protecting plot, intending to set up an anti-werewolf panic amongst humans which would encourage the latter to seek vampire assistance.
He groomed an unwitting Tom as his main tool in this, first secretly filming him transforming and then winning his trust by helping him escape assault charges (Cutler persuaded police that the CCTV footage of the alleged assault showed that Tom wasn't actually fighting anyone — in fact, the vampire Tom fought was invisible to camera).
When Golda, an agent of the Old Ones arrived in Barry, attempting to capture Tom and jeopardise Cutler's plans for him, Cutler first attempted to use Tom to eliminate Golda, and subsequently chose to stake her himself when the opportunity arose.
Cutler went on to post the video of George and Tom transforming up onto the Internet, winning the attention of various websurfers and newsgroup.
He went on to stage a "grand reveal" in which a wolf-form Tom would be tricked into massacring humans on camera, resulting in footage which would go viral and incite an anti-werewolf movement.
When Mr Snow and the Old Ones arrive Cutler attempted to present the results to them as a tribute but was astonished to discover that there was nothing relating to his plan on any news channel (Unknown to Cutler, an independent organisation involving Mr Rook had already gone to work on the cover-up).
An infuriated Mr Snow verbally humiliated Cutler.
Enraged, Cutler turns on the Old Ones and proceeds to carry out his own world domination plans, beginning with an attempt on baby Eve's life.
By sheer willpower, Cutler forced his way into Honolulu Heights, although entering without an invitation caused pain and disfiguring burning all over his body.
He was finally killed by Annie, who staked him via telekinesis before he could complete his goal.
==========
Griffin (Alex Jennings) was the leader of the Barry vampire coven.
Like Herrick, he was a police officer, the local chief constable.
He was responsible for the murder of Nina, and subsequently sent George flowers as a mocking gesture.
He kidnapped Eve, and subsequently George, with the intention of presenting them as trophies for the arriving Old Ones.
He was killed by George at the conclusion of episode 1 when the partially transformed George forcibly fed Griffin his blood, triggering a staking-like reaction.
Dewi (Darren Evans) is a Welsh teenager and recent vampire recruit.
Though disrespected by his fellow vampires in the Barry coven, he was a key player in the subterfuge involving the kidnapping of Eve.
His subsequent dissatisfaction with his treatment (and apparent indifference to the vampire race war) led to him changing sides, leading Annie and Tom to the coven to perform a rescue.
In the subsequent massacre, he staked one of his fellow vampires and consequently marks himself as a traitor.
Tom subsequently gave Dewi his camper van and urged him to get as far away from Barry as possible.
Dewi's current whereabouts are unknown.
Regus (Mark Williams) is a vampire archivist, academic and scientist (also known as The Vampire Recorder) who is first encountered serving the needs of the Barry coven and preparing for the arrival of the Old Ones.
Beneath a bumbling exterior, his own motives appear to be ambiguous: he is the first to recognise Eve as "the War Child" who is apparently destined to destroy the vampire race, yet he is also committed to her survival.
Like Cutler, he survives the Barry massacre and subsequently escapes, having given Annie some information regarding Eve's future role.
Regus was protecting Eve to justify his existence as a recorder of the vampire history, having kept himself confined for centuries doing research.
Although he tried to persuade Annie to depart Barry with Eve, after she, Hal and Tom killed the group of vampires Fergus had taken to try and claim her, he decided that Eve was safe where she was.
He and Michaela subsequently departed to travel the world, Hal and Annie comparing them to Ivan and Daisy.
Leo (Louis Mahoney) is a werewolf.
Since 1955, he has been living in Southend (with the vampire Hal and the ghost Pearl) where he also runs a barber's shop.
Now in old age and poor health, he risks dying every time that he transforms between man and wolf.
As both the barber's shop and the house in which the trio live are registered in his name due to him being the only one of the group who could pass for human, his death will result in his housemates' eviction and loss of livelihood.
Having received a message from what appeared to be an angel, he encouraged the others to visit Honolulu Heights in the belief that Eve could help him, but in the end he died of old age after admitting his love for Pearl, allowing the two of them to pass on.
Pearl (Tamla Kari) is a ghost.
Since 1955, she has been sharing a house in Southend with the vampire Hal and the werewolf Leo.
She initially did not get along with Annie, slightly mocking her for changing her 'support cast' in a few years where Pearl has remained with Hal and Leo for over fifty years, but they eventually achieved a kind of friendship, Pearl even teaching Annie how to keep Eve safe by 'swaddling' her, wrapping Eve in Annie's clothes so that she is invisible to those who cannot see Annie; Pearl apparently did the same thing to help Leo see a concert, smuggling him into the front row under her dress.
After Leo admitted his love for Pearl just before his death, the two passed on together.
Fergus (Anthony Flanagan) is a vampire in the Barry coven, working as a police constable.
Following Griffin's death in episode 1, Fergus takes over as the primary antagonist working against the Honolulu Heights community, he was the partner of Hal during his time as an Old One.
He was killed by Hal after he revealed Hal's past, but not before cutting Michaela's throat.
Michaela Thompson (Laura Patch) is a would-be Gothic poet who appeared in "The Graveyard Shift".
When she became caught up in a vampire raid on the cafe where Hal and Tom worked, they were forced to take her away with them.
She was injured during the subsequent confrontation with Fergus, forcing Regus to turn her to save her life.
The two subsequently departed to travel the world, Hal and Annie comparing them to Ivan and Daisy.
Alfie Kirby (James Lance) is a ghost character from 1975 who appeared in episode 4, claiming to have been a nursery teacher in life who had been sent by Nina to help Annie with Eve.
However, after he killed a GP who visited the house, he went on to subtly sow discord among the group, tricking Tom into thinking that Hal and Annie were ignoring his birthday when they simply didn't know about it, provoking Hal into attacking him while he was holding Eve to give the impression that Hal had gone berserk, and attempting to drive Annie to lose her sense of self by implying that she drove others away.
It was subsequently revealed that he had been sent by the future ghost seeking to kill Eve, and that he had been a serial killer known as the 'Toy Man' in life — being insulted when Hal and Tom didn't know about him — who targeted mothers by giving their children toys.
He was apparently destroyed by the returned Annie when he was about to stab Eve.
Yvonne Bradshaw (Selina Griffiths) was the headmistress of a girl's school that Adam Jacobs visited, the two becoming lovers despite the apparent age gap (Yvonne being in her mid-forties and Adam apparently a teenager).
When the duo fled to Honolulu Heights to escape the press attention caused by their relationship, Hal realised that Yvonne was actually a succubus — her father having been a demon.
Although Yvonne had an unlikely history of attracting romantic attention from various men, the only two which she had fully taken as lovers had died while having sex with her — this turns out to be part of her succubus nature, and Adam has only survived the experience because he was technically already dead.
Although shocked at this revelation, Yvonne and Adam eventually reconciled when Adam saw a news broadcast about Yvonne in a pub and realised that he still cared about her.
Allison Larkin (Ellie Kendrick) is a high-school student and enthusiastic debater who also happens to be a werewolf.
Her condition means that she is blighted by fears that she will kill those close to her.
Discovering Cutler's online footage of Tom and George's videoed transformation provides her with an opportunity to run away from home and do something about this.
She tracks down Tom, using her analytical and computer skills: introduced to his practise of vampire killing, she challenges him to talk to the vampires instead and persuade them to join forces with the werewolves and protect each other from exposure.
Her debating skills prove inadequate when faced with the brutal ruthlessness of the vampires, and she suggests to Tom that she and he can learn from each other.
Tom teaches her how to kill vampires, while she helps him with articulacy and debate (and the two speculate about other issues such as what would happen if werewolves lived on other planets or moons).
As Allison and Tom train together, they begin to fall in love, prompting a double-date with Hal and Alex: this is interrupted when Cutler sets Allison and Tom up to confront and kill the vampire Kane.
Their defeat of Kane leaves Allison aroused and she attempts to pull Tom into a full sexual relationship, but he is dismayed that he is turning her into a killer.
Allison hunts Golda, but Tom dissuades her from killing: he persuades her that her parents still love her, and that there are ways of staying human even if she turns into a werewolf once a month.
Allison still wants to stay with Tom and he finally has to reject her, ordering her to leave and claiming that he doesn't care about her (in order to convince her to return to her human life and escape the violence of his).
Despite her departure, Allison's influence stays with Tom and inspires his decision to end his vampire-slaying activities.
Emrys (Anthony O'Donnell) is a cantankerous old man who lives next door to Honolulu Heights.
Embittered by life (not least due to his wife having cuckolded and abandoned him in favour of her piano teacher), Emrys' path fatally crosses Annie's when one day, enraged by the noise of baby Eve's crying, he bangs on the door and threatens her.
Believing that he is one of the vampires attacking the house, Annie herself attacks Emrys and hurls him over the garden wall before she can realise her mistake.
Emrys is killed by the fall but immediately returns as a ghost.
To assuage her guilt, Annie takes it upon herself to help him solve the "unfinished business" keeping him from fully passing on.
This proves difficult, partially due to Emrys' manipulative dishonesty, and partially because of his own lack of awareness about the meaning of his life and emotions.
For a while it seems that he will have to be accepted into the Honolulu Heights community (although his sly, cynical and lecherous attitudes infuriate the other members of the household).
Annie's suggestion that Emrys confronts his ex-wife and resolves the issues of his failed marriage is also unsuccessful, until he finally realises that what he wants to do is not to reconcile himself with his ex-wife, but to vengefully torment and spook her.
With Annie's help, Emrys carries out a brief and spiteful poltergeist-style haunting of his ex-wife and her lover, and satisfies his need for revenge and mischief.
He subsequently departs into the afterlife through his door, though not before suggesting to Annie that her own "unfinished business", when she comes round to doing it, might "not be a nice thing."
Golda (Amanda Abbington) is a senior vampire and an agent of the Old Ones, who arrives in Barry to oversee their planned arrival.
Aggressive and domineering in style, she presents herself as a 1980s-style female power manager, complete with two male followers (one of whom she has torn the tongue from during a past liaison).
On arrival she relentlessly bullies and demeans Cutler, expressing total scorn and disinterest in him and his plans and treating him as just another minion.
Having learned about Tom's presence in Barry, she orders Cutler to capture him for a dogfight to amuse the Old Ones: with Cutler's own plans for Tom thus threatened, he begins to move against her.
Golda's own minions are eventually staked by Tom and Allison: emboldened, Allison then goes after Golda herself, only to be initially physically overwhelmed and almost killed.
Tom intervenes when he breaks up the duel in order to stop Allison becoming a killer, and to force a more amicable resolution.
Golda appears to agree to the settlement, but subsequently threatens Allison again.
Immediately afterwards, she is staked to death by Cutler, who takes his own opportunity to remove a rival and present himself as an ally.
Kane (Marshall Griffin) is a vampire follower of Golda's.
Aggressive, attention-seeking and stupid, his fondness for action movies leads him to insert various semi-appropriate fighting-man catchphrases and cliches into his speeches and statement, despite these attempts generally being clumsy paraphrases which make little or no sense.
He is, however, a strong fighter in his own right: he initially coming off best in a confrontation with Tom and Allison, but is bemused and irritated by Tom's own clumsy attempts to negotiate rather than fight.
Kane's downfall comes when he enacts one of his favourite cliches — holding Allison hostage while he taunts Tom.
Allison throws him off-guard by rubbing blood from her own bleeding nose into his eyes, which allows Tom to stake him: Kane dies while clutching vainly for an appropriate catchphrase.
Mr Snow (Mark Gatiss) is the eldest of the vampire Old Ones and the oldest recorded vampire on the show (at the age of 3,000 – he knew "the Pharaohs and the son of the carpenter" ).
Due to his extreme age, Mr Snow has several unusual vampire features which include pale white skin, visible black veins under his skin and rotted teeth in place of fangs.
It is stated in a press release that Mr Snow isn't his true name but a name given to him by the other vampires (no-one knows his true name, and he has never told anyone) and that he is the only Old One who doesn't fear Hal.
His first appearance was in an online Series 4 prequel showing the Old Ones' trip over from Bolivia (in which he threatens the human crew of the ship and demands that they give him a victim), and his second was in the closing minutes of Series 4 episode 7, "Making History" (in which he leads several Old Ones into the meeting point at Barry but, finding no one their to greet them, turns and asks the others if they are hungry).
He is next seen in an online clip in which he and two unknown female Old Ones meet with the werewolf Milo, when Snow inquires as to the situation of the Baby Eve and the Honolulu Heights residents, then remarks that he thinks the prime minister will "taste like buttered toast".
Snow attempts to lure Hal back to the vampires, confident that Hal's resistance of his urges was simply a phase.
Mr.
Snow e is destroyed when Annie triggers explosives that Tom had prepared.
The blast also kills baby Eve, who Tom had brought to Mr.
Snow, not understanding why the Old Ones were promising to protect her and keep her alive.
Eve's death results in a variation of the vampire prophecy/parchments that Mr.
Snow feared – proving "that Eve's death is the key to humanity's survival" (stated by Milo in episode 8) by killing the scheming Old Ones (though two are seen escaping first) without actually killing the world's 'average' vampires.
Milo (Michael Wildman) is a werewolf working as an associate of the vampire Old Ones, first appearing as part of Mr Snow's landing party.
By various methods and actions (which he has implied were gruelling, unpleasant and possibly highly compromising) he has won the tolerance of the vampires, who use him as muscle, for bodyguard purposes and for various missions.
Strong, determined and cool-headed, Milo views himself as a survivor and pragmatist, doing what he needs to do in order to work with the strongest faction: nonetheless it does appear that he is sensitive about his choices, accepting the titles of "traitor" and "opportunist" but rejecting that of "coward".
He survived the explosion which killed the Old Ones at the end of Series 4 (having been outside the building fighting off Tom).
His current whereabouts are unknown.
Arthur (Fred Pearson, credited as "Archivist") is another member of the as-yet unidentified organisation as Mr Rook.
Unlike Rook (who appears to be an active field agent) Arthur appears to be predominantly a clerk, archivist and facility organiser.
He also appears to have a convivial working relationship with Rook.
Other named cast members for Series 4 included Daniels (played by Matthew Ashforde).
==========
Crumb (Colin Hoult) is a newly recruited vampire who first appears in episode 1 of series 5.
His original name was Ian Cram: "Crumb" was a derogatory nickname (or habitual mishearing) of his surname by others.
Following his recruitment as a vampire, he takes on the formerly despised nickname out of a sense of vengeance, desiring to be ""the crumb that choked the world.""
He has also describes himself as ""the world's worst nightmare: the victim that suddenly gets super powers.""
Crumb was recruited out of desperation by Hal, who had unwittingly caused his death in a traffic accident.
Hal recruited Crumb in order to save his life as best he could (although there's also a possibility, voiced openly by Crumb, that Hal also needed to create a potentially vicious enemy in order to assert himself as "good" in contrast).
Hal originally kept Crumb prisoner in the basement at Honolulu Heights, although he kept this secret from Tom and Alex: when they discovered Crumb's presence, Alex released him.
During Crumb's life as a human, he was persistently bullied, ignored or passed over, resulting in a growing sense of aggrievement.
He was also single, with his only known relatives or intimates being his sister and niece (whose photograph he kept in his wallet).
At the time of his recruitment, Crumb was on the verge of being bullied out of his low-level office job, and he took this particular resentment with him when defining himself as a vampire.
When faced with his final dismissal, he opted for a generalised vengeance on humanity, locked himself in the office with his former colleagues, then killed and fed on his replacement.
He has since been taken into the custody of Dominic Rook and the Men in Grey, who also covered up the murder.
Crumb's existence and murderous intent has also served to test and strengthen the bond between Hal, Tom and Alex, who have all agreed to share the responsibility for letting Crumb loose on the world.
Crumb's confused, destructive and predatory tendencies are currently being manipulated by Dominic Rook, who is using them to demonstrate to Alistair Frith that the Men in Grey are still needed to protect against supernatural threat.
To this end, Rook stage-managed a meeting between Crumb and Crumb's sister and niece at the height of Crumb's blood craving.
Crumb killed and fed on both women, and this was filmed by Rook for Frith's viewing, after which Crumb was apparently released by Rook, stating that his imprisonment by the Men in Grey was "sort of over now".
While Crumb's human emotions are being rapidly eroded by his growing vampire nature, he refers to this in particular as ""a sore point"" and has exhibited flashes of remorse, horror and grief over his actions.
Crumb has recently recruited a new vampire — Alan, one of the Men in Grey who chose to join him following a moral crisis.
Crumb and Alan were eventually confronted by Hal and Alex, Hal attempting to offer them another chance.
Frustrated at his life and shaken at his possible future, Crumb eventually drank a glass of blood, which turned out to be Tom's blood, the werewolf blood causing Crumb to collapse.
Captain Hatch (Phil Davis) is the name used by a human being possessed by the Devil.
First encountered as a lunatic in 1918, Hatch was kidnapped and deliberately used by Emil Parsons as a vessel to contain the Devil when the latter was summoned during a blood ritual, the Devil having been provoking the vampire/werewolf war to draw on the energy of their struggle.
The ritual failed, since it required the blood of Lady Christine, the werewolf leader, and Hal, along with a ghostly necromancer to work properly, however, Hal substituted the blood of a random vampire soldier, used in the enabling the Devil– still in Hatch's body– to kill two of his three summoners and escape.
While Hatch's spine was seen to shatter during the Devil's entry into his body, he was subsequently seen running from the site of the ritual, leaving his true physical state uncertain.
Hatch is subsequently encountered in the present day, living semi-anonymously as a pensioner in the Barry Grand Hotel.
At this point Hatch appears to be paraplegic and confined to a wheelchair.
He displays some of his true nature in the form of negative human characteristics (bitterness, viciousness, outspoken racism and covert manipulative behaviour) and in his appearance (disheveled verging on decaying), as well as having a minor effect on his environment by causing freshly-picked flowers to decay just by passing by them.
Towards the end of his debut episode, it's revealed that he is behind the spate of suicides at the Hotel when he whispers ""a little secret"" into the ear of the maid Sophie, who's subsequently driven to kill herself (and, before she does so, to write "He Is Risen" in letters of blood on the wall).
Hatch has gone on to foment further trouble, conflict and suicide at the hotel, creating the spiritual pain and misery on which he feeds.
He is using this to strengthen himself in order to regain his godhood, following which he plans to ravage the world.
When Hal and Tom take jobs at the hotel where he is currently staying, Hatch sees a prime opportunity to gain plenty of energy from a vampire/werewolf conflict and devotes himself to promoting discord between them.
He feels threatened by the trinity relationship of Tom, Hal and Alex and is working on plans to isolate and "get rid of" Alex.
He has demonstrated a working relationship with the Gatekeepers (whom he has referred to as "my boys"): this is sufficient to get them to attempt to seize Alex and drag her into the afterlife, Hatch using his powers to trap Alex in the house before Oliver, a child ghost, manages to defeat the Gatekeepers by closing the door and cutting them off from their life source.
He later attempted to provoke another conflict by engineering a situation where Bobby, a socially awkward werewolf, would be unleashed upon the hotel after his transformation and Hal forced to fight him, but this plan failed when Tom contained Bobby himself.
Patsy Ritter (Claire Cage) is the manager at the Barry Grand Hotel, at which Tom and Hal obtain new day jobs at the start of Series 5.
She is attempting to ignore or make light of the suicide rate amongst the staff at the hotel.
She has an overt sexual attraction to Hal and appears to have hired him purely on that basis; conversely, she treats Tom with a bullying contempt.
With this in mind, Hatch manipulates her into staging an "Employee of the Month" contest in order to promote rivalry and discord between Hal and Tom, although their ultimate loyalty to each other means that the scheme fails.
Hatch later uses Patsy's existing stress levels to trigger an apparent cerebral haemorrhage in her before suggesting that she ""takes a dip in the sea.""
Alistair Frith (Toby Whithouse) is the British Home Secretary, who first appears in episode 1 of series 5.
Ruthlessly devoted to his own career, Alistair is in the process of executing government cuts which will, among other things, dissolve Rook's "Men in Grey" department and hand its responsibilities over to the police service (with the clear implication that this will be in a much-reduced form).
This in turn is driving Rook to desperate measures.
