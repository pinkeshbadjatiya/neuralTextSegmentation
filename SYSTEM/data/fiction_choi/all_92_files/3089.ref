==========
This entire stretch of country was amazing; it was characterized by a grandeur that was almost religious, and yet it had an air of sinister desolation.
A great, wild lake, filled with stagnant, black water, in which thousands of reeds were waving to and fro, lay in the midst of a vast circle of naked hills, where nothing grew but broom, or here and there an oak curiously twisted by the wind.
Just one house stood on the banks of that dark lake, a small, low house inhabited by Uncle Joseph, an old boatman, who lived on what he could make by his fishing.
Once a week he carried the fish he caught into the surrounding villages, returning with the few provisions that he needed for his sustenance.
I went to see this old hermit, who offered to take me with him to his nets, and I accepted.
His boat was old, worm-eaten and clumsy, and the skinny old man rowed with a gentle and monotonous stroke that was soothing to the soul, already oppressed by the sadness of the land round about.
It seemed to me as if I were transported to olden times, in the midst of that ancient country, in that primitive boat, which was propelled by a man of another age.
He took up his nets and threw the fish into the bottom of the boat, as the fishermen of the Bible might have done.
Then he took me down to the end of the lake, where I suddenly perceived a ruin on the other side of the bank a dilapidated hut, with an enormous red cross on the wall that looked as if it might have been traced with blood, as it gleamed in the last rays of the setting sun.
"What is that?"
I asked.
"That is where Judas died," the man replied, crossing himself.
I was not surprised, being almost prepared for this strange answer.
Still I asked:
"Judas?
What Judas?"
"The Wandering Jew, monsieur," he added.
I asked him to tell me this legend.
But it was better than a legend, being a true story, and quite a recent one, since Uncle Joseph had known the man.
This hut had formerly been occupied by a large woman, a kind of beggar, who lived on public charity.
Uncle Joseph did not remember from whom she had this hut.
One evening an old man with a white beard, who seemed to be at least two hundred years old, and who could hardly drag himself along, asked alms of this forlorn woman, as he passed her dwelling.
"Sit down, father," she replied; "everything here belongs to all the world, since it comes from all the world."
He sat down on a stone before the door.
He shared the woman's bread, her bed of leaves, and her house.
He did not leave her again, for he had come to the end of his travels.
"It was Our Lady the Virgin who permitted this, monsieur," Joseph added, "it being a woman who had opened her door to a Judas, for this old vagabond was the Wandering Jew.
It was not known at first in the country, but the people suspected it very soon, because he was always walking; it had become a sort of second nature to him."
And suspicion had been aroused by still another thing.
This woman, who kept that stranger with her, was thought to be a Jewess, for no one had ever seen her at church.
For ten miles around no one ever called her anything else but the Jewess.
When the little country children saw her come to beg they cried out: "Mamma, mamma, here is the Jewess!"
The old man and she began to go out together into the neighboring districts, holding out their hands at all the doors, stammering supplications into the ears of all the passers.
They could be seen at all hours of the day, on by-paths, in the villages, or again eating bread, sitting in the noon heat under the shadow of some solitary tree.
And the country people began to call the beggar Old Judas.
One day he brought home in his sack two little live pigs, which a farmer had given him after he had cured the farmer of some sickness.
Soon he stopped begging, and devoted himself entirely to his pigs.
He took them out to feed by the lake, or under isolated oaks, or in the near-by valleys.
The woman, however, went about all day begging, but she always came back to him in the evening.
He also did not go to church, and no one ever had seen him cross himself before the wayside crucifixes.
All this gave rise to much gossip:
One night his companion was attacked by a fever and began to tremble like a leaf in the wind.
He went to the nearest town to get some medicine, and then he shut himself up with her, and was not seen for six days.
The priest, having heard that the "Jewess" was about to die, came to offer the consolation of his religion and administer the last sacrament.
Was she a Jewess?
He did not know.
But in any case, he wished to try to save her soul.
Hardly had he knocked at the door when old Judas appeared on the threshold, breathing hard, his eyes aflame, his long beard agitated, like rippling water, and he hurled blasphemies in an unknown language, extending his skinny arms in order to prevent the priest from entering.
The priest attempted to speak, offered his purse and his aid, but the old man kept on abusing him, making gestures with his hands as if throwing; stones at him.
Then the priest retired, followed by the curses of the beggar.
The companion of old Judas died the following day.
He buried her himself, in front of her door.
They were people of so little account that no one took any interest in them.
Then they saw the man take his pigs out again to the lake and up the hillsides.
And he also began begging again to get food.
But the people gave him hardly anything, as there was so much gossip about him.
Every one knew, moreover, how he had treated the priest.
Then he disappeared.
That was during Holy Week, but no one paid any attention to him.
But on Easter Sunday the boys and girls who had gone walking out to the lake heard a great noise in the hut.
The door was locked; but the boys broke it in, and the two pigs ran out, jumping like gnats.
No one ever saw them again.
The whole crowd went in; they saw some old rags on the floor, the beggar's hat, some bones, clots of dried blood and bits of flesh in the hollows of the skull.
His pigs had devoured him.
"This happened on Good Friday, monsieur."
Joseph concluded his story, "three hours after noon."
"How do you know that?"
I asked him.
"There is no doubt about that," he replied.
I did not attempt to make him understand that it could easily happen that the famished animals had eaten their master, after he had died suddenly in his hut.
As for the cross on the wall, it had appeared one morning, and no one knew what hand traced it in that strange color.
Since then no one doubted any longer that the Wandering Jew had died on this spot.
I myself believed it for one hour
==========
He was a tall man of forty or thereabout, this Jules Chicot, the innkeeper of Spreville, with a red face and a round stomach, and said by those who knew him to be a smart business man.
He stopped his buggy in front of Mother Magloire's farmhouse, and, hitching the horse to the gatepost, went in at the gate.
Chicot owned some land adjoining that of the old woman, which he had been coveting for a long while, and had tried in vain to buy a score of times, but she had always obstinately refused to part with it.
"I was born here, and here I mean to die," was all she said.
He found her peeling potatoes outside the farmhouse door.
She was a woman of about seventy-two, very thin, shriveled and wrinkled, almost dried up in fact and much bent but as active and untiring as a girl.
Chicot patted her on the back in a friendly fashion and then sat down by her on a stool.
"Well mother, you are always pretty well and hearty, I am glad to see."
"Nothing to complain of, considering, thank you.
And how are you, Monsieur Chicot?"
"Oh, pretty well, thank you, except a few rheumatic pains occasionally; otherwise I have nothing to complain of."
"So much the better."
And she said no more, while Chicot watched her going on with her work.
Her crooked, knotted fingers, hard as a lobster's claws, seized the tubers, which were lying in a pail, as if they had been a pair of pincers, and she peeled them rapidly, cutting off long strips of skin with an old knife which she held in the other hand, throwing the potatoes into the water as they were done.
Three daring fowls jumped one after the other into her lap, seized a bit of peel and then ran away as fast as their legs would carry them with it in their beak.
Chicot seemed embarrassed, anxious, with something on the tip of his tongue which he could not say.
At last he said hurriedly:
"Listen, Mother Magloire—"
"Well, what is it?"
"You are quite sure that you do not want to sell your land?"
"Certainly not; you may make up your mind to that.
What I have said I have said, so don't refer to it again."
"Very well; only I think I know of an arrangement that might suit us both very well."
"What is it?"
"Just this.
You shall sell it to me and keep it all the same.
You don't understand?
Very well, then follow me in what I am going to say."
The old woman left off peeling potatoes and looked at the innkeeper attentively from under her heavy eyebrows, and he went on:
"Let me explain myself.
Every month I will give you a hundred and fifty francs.
You understand me!
suppose!
Every month I will come and bring you thirty crowns, and it will not make the slightest difference in your life—not the very slightest.
You will have your own home just as you have now, need not trouble yourself about me, and will owe me nothing; all you will have to do will be to take my money.
Will that arrangement suit you?"
He looked at her good-humoredly, one might almost have said benevolently, and the old woman returned his looks distrustfully, as if she suspected a trap, and said:
"It seems all right as far as I am concerned, but it will not give you the farm."
"Never mind about that," he said; "you may remain here as long as it pleases God Almighty to let you live; it will be your home.
Only you will sign a deed before a lawyer making it over to me; after your death.
You have no children, only nephews and nieces for whom you don't care a straw.
Will that suit you?
You will keep everything during your life, and I will give you the thirty crowns a month.
It is pure gain as far as you are concerned."
The old woman was surprised, rather uneasy, but, nevertheless, very much tempted to agree, and answered:
"I don't say that I will not agree to it, but I must think about it.
Come back in a week, and we will talk it over again, and I will then give you my definite answer."
And Chicot went off as happy as a king who had conquered an empire.
Mother Magloire was thoughtful, and did not sleep at all that night; in fact, for four days she was in a fever of hesitation.
She suspected that there was something underneath the offer which was not to her advantage; but then the thought of thirty crowns a month, of all those coins clinking in her apron, falling to her, as it were, from the skies, without her doing anything for it, aroused her covetousness.
She went to the notary and told him about it.
He advised her to accept Chicot's offer, but said she ought to ask for an annuity of fifty instead of thirty, as her farm was worth sixty thousand francs at the lowest calculation.
"If you live for fifteen years longer," he said, "even then he will only have paid forty-five thousand francs for it."
The old woman trembled with joy at this prospect of getting fifty crowns a month, but she was still suspicious, fearing some trick, and she remained a long time with the lawyer asking questions without being able to make up her mind to go.
At last she gave him instructions to draw up the deed and returned home with her head in a whirl, just as if she had drunk four jugs of new cider.
When Chicot came again to receive her answer she declared, after a lot of persuading, that she could not make up her mind to agree to his proposal, though she was all the time trembling lest he should not consent to give the fifty crowns, but at last, when he grew urgent, she told him what she expected for her farm.
He looked surprised and disappointed and refused.
Then, in order to convince him, she began to talk about the probable duration of her life.
"I am certainly not likely to live more than five or six years longer.
I am nearly seventy-three, and far from strong, even considering my age.
The other evening I thought I was going to die, and could hardly manage to crawl into bed."
But Chicot was not going to be taken in.
"Come, come, old lady, you are as strong as the church tower, and will live till you are a hundred at least; you will no doubt see me put under ground first."
The whole day was spent in discussing the money, and as the old woman would not give in, the innkeeper consented to give the fifty crowns, and she insisted upon having ten crowns over and above to strike the bargain.
Three years passed and the old dame did not seem to have grown a day older.
Chicot was in despair, and it seemed to him as if he had been paying that annuity for fifty years, that he had been taken in, done, ruined.
From time to time he went to see the old lady, just as one goes in July to see when the harvest is likely to begin.
She always met him with a cunning look, and one might have supposed that she was congratulating herself on the trick she had played him.
Seeing how well and hearty she seemed he very soon got into his buggy again, growling to himself:
"Will you never die, you old hag?"
He did not know what to do, and he felt inclined to strangle her when he saw her.
He hated her with a ferocious, cunning hatred, the hatred of a peasant who has been robbed, and began to cast about for some means of getting rid of her.
One day he came to see her again, rubbing his hands as he did the first time he proposed the bargain, and, after having chatted for a few minutes, he said:
"Why do you never come and have a bit of dinner at my place when you are in Spreville?
The people are talking about it, and saying we are not on friendly terms, and that pains me.
You know it will cost you nothing if you come, for I don't look at the price of a dinner.
Come whenever you feel inclined; I shall be very glad to see you."
Old Mother Magloire did not need to be asked twice, and the next day but one, as she had to go to the town in any case, it being market day, she let her man drive her to Chicot's place, where the buggy was put in the barn while she went into the house to get her dinner.
The innkeeper was delighted and treated her like a lady, giving her roast fowl, black pudding, leg of mutton and bacon and cabbage.
But she ate next to nothing.
She had always been a small eater, and had generally lived on a little soup and a crust of bread and butter.
Chicot was disappointed and pressed her to eat more, but she refused, and she would drink little, and declined coffee, so he asked her:
"But surely you will take a little drop of brandy or liqueur?"
"Well, as to that, I don't know that I will refuse."
Whereupon he shouted out:
"Rosalie, bring the superfine brandy—the special—you know."
The servant appeared, carrying a long bottle ornamented with a paper vine-leaf, and he filled two liqueur glasses.
"Just try that; you will find it first rate."
The good woman drank it slowly in sips, so as to make the pleasure last all the longer, and when she had finished her glass, she said:
"Yes, that is first rate!"
Almost before she had said it Chicot had poured her out another glassful.
She wished to refuse, but it was too late, and she drank it very slowly, as she had done the first, and he asked her to have a third.
She objected, but he persisted.
"It is as mild as milk, you know; I can drink ten or a dozen glasses without any ill effects; it goes down like sugar and does not go to the head; one would think that it evaporated on the tongue: It is the most wholesome thing you can drink."
She took it, for she really enjoyed it, but she left half the glass.
Then Chicot, in an excess of generosity, said:
"Look here, as it is so much to your taste, I will give you a small keg of it, just to show that you and I are still excellent friends."
So she took one away with her, feeling slightly overcome by the effects of what she had drunk.
The next day the innkeeper drove into her yard and took a little iron-hooped keg out of his gig.
He insisted on her tasting the contents, to make sure it was the same delicious article, and, when they had each of them drunk three more glasses, he said as he was going away:
"Well, you know when it is all gone there is more left; don't be modest, for I shall not mind.
The sooner it is finished the better pleased I shall be."
Four days later he came again.
The old woman was outside her door cutting up the bread for her soup.
He went up to her and put his face close to hers, so that he might smell her breath; and when he smelt the alcohol he felt pleased.
"I suppose you will give me a glass of the Special?"
he said.
And they had three glasses each.
Soon, however, it began to be whispered abroad that Mother Magloire was in the habit of getting drunk all by herself.
She was picked up in her kitchen, then in her yard, then in the roads in the neighborhood, and she was often brought home like a log.
The innkeeper did not go near her any more, and, when people spoke to him about her, he used to say, putting on a distressed look:
"It is a great pity that she should have taken to drink at her age, but when people get old there is no remedy.
It will be the death of her in the long run."
And it certainly was the death of her.
She died the next winter.
About Christmas time she fell down, unconscious, in the snow, and was found dead the next morning
==========
Father Boitelle (Antoine) made a specialty of undertaking dirty jobs all through the countryside.
Whenever there was a ditch or a cesspool to be cleaned out, a dunghill removed, a sewer cleansed, or any dirt hole whatever, he way always employed to do it.
He would come with the instruments of his trade, his sabots covered with dirt, and set to work, complaining incessantly about his occupation.
When people asked him then why he did this loathsome work, he would reply resignedly:
"Faith, 'tis for my children, whom I must support.
This brings me in more than anything else."
He had, indeed, fourteen children.
If any one asked him what had become of them, he would say with an air of indifference:
"There are only eight of them left in the house.
One is out at service and five are married."
When the questioner wanted to know whether they were well married, he replied vivaciously:
"I did not oppose them.
I opposed them in nothing.
They married just as they pleased.
We shouldn't go against people's likings, it turns out badly.
I am a night scavenger because my parents went against my likings.
But for that I would have become a workman like the others."
Here is the way his parents had thwarted him in his likings:
He was at the time a soldier stationed at Havre, not more stupid than another, or sharper either, a rather simple fellow, however.
When he was not on duty, his greatest pleasure was to walk along the quay, where the bird dealers congregate.
Sometimes alone, sometimes with a soldier from his own part of the country, he would slowly saunter along by cages containing parrots with green backs and yellow heads from the banks of the Amazon, or parrots with gray backs and red heads from Senegal, or enormous macaws, which look like birds reared in hot-houses, with their flower-like feathers, their plumes and their tufts.
Parrots of every size, who seem painted with minute care by the miniaturist, God Almighty, and the little birds, all the smaller birds hopped about, yellow, blue and variegated, mingling their cries with the noise of the quay; and adding to the din caused by unloading the vessels, as well as by passengers and vehicles, a violent clamor, loud, shrill and deafening, as if from some distant forest of monsters.
Boitelle would pause, with wondering eyes, wide-open mouth, laughing and enraptured, showing his teeth to the captive cockatoos, who kept nodding their white or yellow topknots toward the glaring red of his breeches and the copper buckle of his belt.
When he found a bird that could talk he put questions to it, and if it happened at the time to be disposed to reply and to hold a conversation with him he would carry away enough amusement to last him till evening.
He also found heaps of amusement in looking at the monkeys, and could conceive no greater luxury for a rich man than to own these animals as one owns cats and dogs.
This kind of taste for the exotic he had in his blood, as people have a taste for the chase, or for medicine, or for the priesthood.
He could not help returning to the quay every time the gates of the barracks opened, drawn toward it by an irresistible longing.
On one occasion, having stopped almost in ecstasy before an enormous macaw, which was swelling out its plumes, bending forward and bridling up again as if making the court curtseys of parrot-land, he saw the door of a little cafe adjoining the bird dealer's shop open, and a young negress appeared, wearing on her head a red silk handkerchief.
She was sweeping into the street the corks and sand of the establishment.
Boitelle's attention was soon divided between the bird and the woman, and he really could not tell which of these two beings he contemplated with the greater astonishment and delight.
The negress, having swept the rubbish into the street, raised her eyes, and, in her turn, was dazzled by the soldier's uniform.
There she stood facing him with her broom in her hands as if she were bringing him a rifle, while the macaw continued bowing.
But at the end of a few seconds the soldier began to feel embarrassed at this attention, and he walked away quietly so as not to look as if he were beating a retreat.
But he came back.
Almost every day he passed before the Cafe des Colonies, and often he could distinguish through the window the figure of the little black-skinned maid serving "bocks" or glasses of brandy to the sailors of the port.
Frequently, too, she would come out to the door on seeing him; soon, without even having exchanged a word, they smiled at one another like acquaintances; and Boitelle felt his heart touched when he suddenly saw, glittering between the dark lips of the girl, a shining row of white teeth.
At length, one day he ventured to enter, and was quite surprised to find that she could speak French like every one else.
The bottle of lemonade, of which she was good enough to accept a glassful, remained in the soldier's recollection memorably delicious, and it became a custom with him to come and absorb in this little tavern on the quay all the agreeable drinks which he could afford.
For him it was a treat, a happiness, on which his thoughts dwelt constantly, to watch the black hand of the little maid pouring something into his glass while her teeth laughed more than her eyes.
At the end of two months they became fast friends, and Boitelle, after his first astonishment at discovering that this negress had as good principles as honest French girls, that she exhibited a regard for economy, industry, religion and good conduct, loved her more on that account, and was so charmed with her that he wanted to marry her.
He told her his intentions, which made her dance with joy.
She had also a little money, left her by, a female oyster dealer, who had picked her up when she had been left on the quay at Havre by an American captain.
This captain had found her, when she was only about six years old, lying on bales of cotton in the hold of his ship, some hours after his departure from New York.
On his arrival in Havre he abandoned to the care of this compassionate oyster dealer the little black creature, who had been hidden on board his vessel, he knew not why or by whom.
The oyster woman having died, the young negress became a servant at the Colonial Tavern.
Antoine Boitelle added: "This will be all right if my parents don't oppose it.
I will never go against them, you understand, never!
I'm going to say a word or two to them the first time I go back to the country."
On the following week, in fact, having obtained twenty-four hours' leave, he went to see his family, who cultivated a little farm at Tourteville, near Yvetot.
He waited till the meal was finished, the hour when the coffee baptized with brandy makes people more open-hearted, before informing his parents that he had found a girl who satisfied his tastes, all his tastes, so completely that there could not exist any other in all the world so perfectly suited to him.
The old people, on hearing this, immediately assumed a cautious manner and wanted explanations.
He had concealed nothing from them except the color of her skin.
She was a servant, without much means, but strong, thrifty, clean, well-conducted and sensible.
All these things were better than money would be in the hands of a bad housewife.
Moreover, she had a few sous, left her by a woman who had reared her, a good number of sous, almost a little dowry, fifteen hundred francs in the savings bank.
The old people, persuaded by his talk, and relying also on their own judgment, were gradually weakening, when he came to the delicate point.
Laughing in rather a constrained fashion, he said:
"There's only one thing you may not like.
She is not a white slip."
They did not understand, and he had to explain at some length and very cautiously, to avoid shocking them, that she belonged to the dusky race of which they had only seen samples in pictures at Epinal.
Then they became restless, perplexed, alarmed, as if he had proposed a union with the devil.
The mother said: "Black?
How much of her is black?
Is the whole of her?"
He replied: "Certainly.
Everywhere, just as you are white everywhere."
The father interposed: "Black?
Is it as black as the pot?"
The son answered: "Perhaps a little less than that.
She is black, but not disgustingly black.
The cure's cassock is black, but it is not uglier than a surplice which is white."
The father said: "Are there more black people besides her in her country?"
And the son, with an air of conviction, exclaimed: "Certainly!"
But the old man shook his head.
"That must be unpleasant."
And the son:
"It isn't more disagreeable than anything else when you get accustomed to it."
The mother asked:
"It doesn't soil the underwear more than other skins, this black skin?"
"Not more than your own, as it is her proper color."
Then, after many other questions, it was agreed that the parents should see this girl before coming; to any decision, and that the young fellow, whose term of military service would be over in a month, should bring her to the house in order that they might examine her and decide by talking the matter over whether or not she was too dark to enter the Boitelle family.
Antoine accordingly announced that on Sunday, the 22d of May, the day of his discharge, he would start for Tourteville with his sweetheart.
She had put on, for this journey to the house of her lover's parents, her most beautiful and most gaudy clothes, in which yellow, red and blue were the prevailing colors, so that she looked as if she were adorned for a national festival.
At the terminus, as they were leaving Havre, people stared at her, and Boitelle was proud of giving his arm to a person who commanded so much attention.
Then, in the third-class carriage, in which she took a seat by his side, she aroused so much astonishment among the country folks that the people in the adjoining compartments stood up on their benches to look at her over the wooden partition which divides the compartments.
A child, at sight of her, began to cry with terror, another concealed his face in his mother's apron.
Everything went off well, however, up to their arrival at their destination.
But when the train slackened its rate of motion as they drew near Yvetot, Antoine felt: ill at ease, as he would have done at a review when; he did not know his drill practice.
Then, as he; leaned his head out, he recognized in the distance: his father, holding the bridle of the horse harnessed to a carryall, and his mother, who had come forward to the grating, behind which stood those who were expecting friends.
He alighted first, gave his hand to his sweetheart, and holding himself erect, as if he were escorting a general, he went to meet his family.
The mother, on seeing this black lady in variegated costume in her son's company, remained so stupefied that she could not open her mouth; and the father found it hard to hold the horse, which the engine or the negress caused to rear continuously.
But Antoine, suddenly filled with unmixed joy at seeing once more the old people, rushed forward with open arms, embraced his mother, embraced his father, in spite of the nag's fright, and then turning toward his companion, at whom the passengers on the platform stopped to stare with amazement, he proceeded to explain:
"Here she is!
I told you that, at first sight, she is not attractive; but as soon as you know her, I can assure you there's not a better sort in the whole world.
Say good-morning to her so that she may not feel badly."
Thereupon Mere Boitelle, almost frightened out of her wits, made a sort of curtsy, while the father took off his cap, murmuring:
"I wish you good luck!"
Then, without further delay, they climbed into the carryall, the two women at the back, on seats which made them jump up and down as the vehicle went jolting along the road, and the two men in front on the front seat.
Nobody spoke.
Antoine, ill at ease, whistled a barrack-room air; his father whipped the nag; and his mother, from where she sat in the corner, kept casting sly glances at the negress, whose forehead and cheekbones shone in the sunlight like well-polished shoes.
Wishing to break the ice, Antoine turned round.
"Well," said he, "we don't seem inclined to talk."
"We must have time," replied the old woman.
He went on:
"Come!
Tell us the little story about that hen of yours that laid eight eggs."
It was a funny anecdote of long standing in the family.
But, as his mother still remained silent, paralyzed by her emotion, he undertook himself to tell the story, laughing as he did so at the memorable incident.
The father, who knew it by heart brightened at the opening words of the narrative; his wife soon followed his example; and the negress herself, when he reached the drollest part of it, suddenly gave vent to a laugh, such a loud, rolling torrent of laughter that the horse, becoming excited, broke into a gallop for a while.
This served to cement their acquaintance.
They all began to chat.
They had scarcely reached the house and had all alighted, when Antoine conducted his sweetheart to a room, so that she might take off her dress, to avoid staining it, as she was going to prepare a nice dish, intended to win the old people's affections through their stomachs.
He drew his parents outside the house, and, with beating heart, asked:
"Well, what do you say now?"
The father said nothing.
The mother, less timid, exclaimed:
"She is too black.
No, indeed, this is too much for me.
It turns my blood."
"You will get used to it," said Antoine.
"Perhaps so, but not at first."
They went into the house, where the good woman was somewhat affected at the spectacle of the negress engaged in cooking.
She at once proceeded to assist her, with petticoats tucked up, active in spite of her age.
The meal was an excellent one, very long, very enjoyable.
When they were taking a turn after dinner, Antoine took his father aside.
"Well, dad, what do you say about it?"
The peasant took care never to compromise himself.
"I have no opinion about it.
Ask your mother."
So Antoine went back to his mother, and, detaining her behind the rest, said:
"Well, mother, what do you think of her?"
"My poor lad, she is really too black.
If she were only a little less black, I would not go against you, but this is too much.
One would think it was Satan!"
He did not press her, knowing how obstinate the old woman had always been, but he felt a tempest of disappointment sweeping over his heart.
He was turning over in his mind what he ought to do, what plan he could devise, surprised, moreover, that she had not conquered them already as she had captivated himself.
And they, all four, walked along through the wheat fields, having gradually relapsed into silence.
Whenever they passed a fence they saw a countryman sitting on the stile, and a group of brats climbed up to stare at them, and every one rushed out into the road to see the "black" whore young Boitelle had brought home with him.
At a distance they noticed people scampering across the fields just as when the drum beats to draw public attention to some living phenomenon.
Pere and Mere Boitelle, alarmed at this curiosity, which was exhibited everywhere through the country at their approach, quickened their pace, walking side by side, and leaving their son far behind.
His dark companion asked what his parents thought of her.
He hesitatingly replied that they had not yet made up their minds.
But on the village green people rushed out of all the houses in a flutter of excitement; and, at the sight of the gathering crowd, old Boitelle took to his heels, and regained his abode, while Antoine; swelling with rage, his sweetheart on his arm, advanced majestically under the staring eyes, which opened wide in amazement.
He understood that it was at an end, and there was no hope for him, that he could not marry his negress.
She also understood it; and as they drew near the farmhouse they both began to weep.
As soon as they had got back to the house, she once more took off her dress to aid the mother in the household duties, and followed her everywhere, to the dairy, to the stable, to the hen house, taking on herself the hardest part of the work, repeating always: "Let me do it, Madame Boitelle," so that, when night came on, the old woman, touched but inexorable, said to her son: "She is a good girl, all the same.
It's a pity she is so black; but indeed she is too black.
I could not get used to it.
She must go back again.
She is too, too black!"
And young Boitelle said to his sweetheart:
"She will not consent.
She thinks you are too black.
You must go back again.
I will go with you to the train.
No matter—don't fret.
I am going to talk to them after you have started."
He then took her to the railway station, still cheering her with hope, and, when he had kissed her, he put her into the train, which he watched as it passed out of sight, his eyes swollen with tears.
In vain did he appeal to the old people.
They would never give their consent.
And when he had told this story, which was known all over the country, Antoine Boitelle would always add:
"From that time forward I have had no heart for anything—for anything at all.
No trade suited me any longer, and so I became what I am—a night scavenger."
People would say to him:
"Yet you got married."
"Yes, and I can't say that my wife didn't please me, seeing that I have fourteen children; but she is not the other one, oh, no—certainly not!
==========
This story was told during the hunting season at the Chateau Baneville.
The autumn had been rainy and sad.
The red leaves, instead of rustling under the feet, were rotting under the heavy downfalls.
The forest was as damp as it could be.
From it came an odor of must, of rain, of soaked grass and wet earth; and the sportsmen, their backs hunched under the downpour, mournful dogs, with tails between their legs and hairs sticking to their sides, and the young women, with their clothes drenched, returned every evening, tired in body and in mind.
After dinner, in the large drawing-room, everybody played lotto, without enjoyment, while the wind whistled madly around the house.
Then they tried telling stories like those they read in books, but no one was able to invent anything amusing.
The hunters told tales of wonderful shots and of the butchery of rabbits; and the women racked their brains for ideas without revealing the imagination of Scheherezade.
They were about to give up this diversion when a young woman, who was idly caressing the hand of an old maiden aunt, noticed a little ring made of blond hair, which she had often seen, without paying any attention to it.
She fingered it gently and asked, "Auntie, what is this ring?
It looks as if it were made from the hair of a child."
The old lady blushed, grew pale, then answered in a trembling voice: "It is sad, so sad that I never wish to speak of it.
All the unhappiness of my life comes from that.
I was very young then, and the memory has remained so painful that I weep every time I think of it."
Immediately everybody wished to know the story, but the old lady refused to tell it.
Finally, after they had coaxed her for a long time, she yielded.
Here is the story:
"You have often heard me speak of the Santeze family, now extinct.
I knew the last three male members of this family.
They all died in the same manner; this hair belongs to the last one.
He was thirteen when he killed himself for me.
That seems strange to you, doesn't it?
"Oh!
it was a strange family—mad, if you will, but a charming madness, the madness of love.
From father to son, all had violent passions which filled their whole being, which impelled them to do wild things, drove them to frantic enthusiasm, even to crime.
This was born in them, just as burning devotion is in certain souls.
Trappers have not the same nature as minions of the drawing-room.
There was a saying: 'As passionate as a Santeze.'
This could be noticed by looking at them.
They all had wavy hair, falling over their brows, curly beards and large eyes whose glance pierced and moved one, though one could not say why.
"The grandfather of the owner of this hair, of whom it is the last souvenir, after many adventures, duels and elopements, at about sixty-five fell madly in love with his farmer's daughter.
I knew them both.
She was blond, pale, distinguished-looking, with a slow manner of talking, a quiet voice and a look so gentle that one might have taken her for a Madonna.
The old nobleman took her to his home and was soon so captivated with her that he could not live without her for a minute.
His daughter and daughter-in-law, who lived in the chateau, found this perfectly natural, love was such a tradition in the family.
Nothing in regard to a passion surprised them, and if one spoke before them of parted lovers, even of vengeance after treachery, both said in the same sad tone: 'Oh, how he must have suffered to come to that point!'
That was all.
They grew sad over tragedies of love, but never indignant, even when they were criminal.
"Now, one day a young man named Monsieur de Gradelle, who had been invited for the shooting, eloped with the young girl.
"Monsieur de Santeze remained calm as if nothing had happened, but one morning he was found hanging in the kennels, among his dogs.
"His son died in the same manner in a hotel in Paris during a journey which he made there in 1841, after being deceived by a singer from the opera.
"He left a twelve-year-old child and a widow, my mother's sister.
She came to my father's house with the boy, while we were living at Bertillon.
I was then seventeen.
"You have no idea how wonderful and precocious this Santeze child was.
One might have thought that all the tenderness and exaltation of the whole race had been stored up in this last one.
He was always dreaming and walking about alone in a great alley of elms leading from the chateau to the forest.
I watched from my window this sentimental boy, who walked with thoughtful steps, his hands behind his back, his head bent, and at times stopping to raise his eyes as if he could see and understand things that were not comprehensible at his age.
"Often, after dinner on clear evenings, he would say to me: 'Let us go outside and dream, cousin.'
And we would go outside together in the park.
He would stop quickly before a clearing where the white vapor of the moon lights the woods, and he would press my hand, saying: 'Look!
look!
but you don't understand me; I feel it.
If you understood me, we should be happy.
One must love to know!
I would laugh and then kiss this child, who loved me madly.
"Often, after dinner, he would sit on my mother's knees.
'Come, auntie,' he would say, 'tell me some love-stories.'
And my mother, as a joke, would tell him all the old legends of the family, all the passionate adventures of his forefathers, for thousands of them were current, some true and some false.
It was their reputation for love and gallantry which was the ruin of every one of these-men; they gloried in it and then thought that they had to live up to the renown of their house.
"The little fellow became exalted by these tender or terrible stories, and at times he would clap his hands, crying: 'I, too, I, too, know how to love, better than all of them!'
"Then, he began to court me in a timid and tender manner, at which every one laughed, it was, so amusing.
Every morning I had some flowers picked by him, and every evening before going to his room he would kiss my hand and murmur: 'I love you!'
"I was guilty, very guilty, and I grieved continually about it, and I have been doing penance all my life; I have remained an old maid—or, rather, I have lived as a widowed fiancee, his widow.
"I was amused at this childish tenderness, and I even encouraged him.
I was coquettish, as charming as with a man, alternately caressing and severe.
I maddened this child.
It was a game for me and a joyous diversion for his mother and mine.
He was twelve!
think of it!
Who would have taken this atom's passion seriously?
I kissed him as often as he wished; I even wrote him little notes, which were read by our respective mothers; and he answered me by passionate letters, which I have kept.
Judging himself as a man, he thought that our loving intimacy was secret.
We had forgotten that he was a Santeze.
"This lasted for about a year.
One evening in the park he fell at my feet and, as he madly kissed the hem of my dress, he kept repeating: 'I love you!
I love you!
I love you!
If ever you deceive me, if ever you leave me for another, I'll do as my father did.'
And he added in a hoarse voice, which gave me a shiver: 'You know what he did!'
"I stood there astonished.
He arose, and standing on the tips of his toes in order to reach my ear, for I was taller than he, he pronounced my first name: 'Genevieve!'
in such a gentle, sweet, tender tone that I trembled all over.
I stammered: 'Let us return!
let us return!'
He said no more and followed me; but as we were going up the steps of the porch, he stopped me, saying: 'You know, if ever you leave me, I'll kill myself.'
"This time I understood that I had gone too far, and I became quite reserved.
One day, as he was reproaching me for this, I answered: 'You are now too old for jesting and too young for serious love.
I'll wait.'
"I thought that this would end the matter.
In the autumn he was sent to a boarding-school.
When he returned the following summer I was engaged to be married.
He understood immediately, and for a week he became so pensive that I was quite anxious.
"On the morning of the ninth day I saw a little paper under my door as I got up.
I seized it, opened it and read: 'You have deserted me and you know what I said.
It is death to which you have condemned me.
As I do not wish to be found by another than you, come to the park just where I told you last year that I loved you and look in the air.'
"I thought that I should go mad.
I dressed as quickly as I could and ran wildly to the place that he had mentioned.
His little cap was on the ground in the mud.
It had been raining all night.
I raised my eyes and saw something swinging among the leaves, for the wind was blowing a gale.
"I don't know what I did after that.
I must have screamed at first, then fainted and fallen, and finally have run to the chateau.
The next thing that I remember I was in bed, with my mother sitting beside me.
"I thought that I had dreamed all this in a frightful nightmare.
I stammered: 'And what of him, what of him, Gontran?'
There was no answer.
It was true!
"I did not dare see him again, but I asked for a lock of his blond hair.
Here—here it is!"
And the old maid stretched out her trembling hand in a despairing gesture.
Then she blew her nose several times, wiped her eyes and continued:
"I broke off my marriage—without saying why.
And I—I always have remained the—the widow of this thirteen-year-old boy."
Then her head fell on her breast and she wept for a long time
==========
A great English poet has just crossed over to France in order to greet Victor Hugo.
All the newspapers are full of his name and he is the great topic of conversation in all drawing-rooms.
Fifteen years ago I had occasion several times to meet Algernon Charles Swinburne.
I will attempt to show him just as I saw him and to give an idea of the strange impression he made on me, which will remain with me throughout time.
I believe it was in 1867 or in 1868 that an unknown young Englishman came to Etretat and bought a little but hidden under great trees.
It was said that he lived there, always alone, in a strange manner; and he aroused the inimical surprise of the natives, for the inhabitants were sullen and foolishly malicious, as they always are in little towns.
They declared that this whimsical Englishman ate nothing but boiled.
roasted or stewed monkey; that he would see no one; that he talked to himself hours at a time and many other surprising things that made people think that he was different from other men.
They were surprised that he should live alone with a monkey.
Had it been a cat or a dog they would have said nothing.
But a monkey!
Was that not frightful?
What savage tastes the man must have!
I knew this young man only from seeing him in the streets.
He was short, plump, without being fat, mild-looking, and he wore a little blond mustache, which was almost invisible.
Chance brought us together.
This savage had amiable and pleasing manners, but he was one of those strange Englishmen that one meets here and there throughout the world.
Endowed with remarkable intelligence, he seemed to live in a fantastic dream, as Edgar Poe must have lived.
He had translated into English a volume of strange Icelandic legends, which I ardently desired to see translated into French.
He loved the supernatural, the dismal and grewsome, but he spoke of the most marvellous things with a calmness that was typically English, to which his gentle and quiet voice gave a semblance of reality that was maddening.
Full of a haughty disdain for the world, with its conventions, prejudices and code of morality, he had nailed to his house a name that was boldly impudent.
The keeper of a lonely inn who should write on his door: "Travellers murdered here!"
could not make a more sinister jest.
I never had entered his dwelling, when one day I received an invitation to luncheon, following an accident that had occurred to one of his friends, who had been almost drowned and whom I had attempted to rescue.
Although I was unable to reach the man until he had already been rescued, I received the hearty thanks of the two Englishmen, and the following day I called upon them.
The friend was a man about thirty years old.
He bore an enormous head on a child's body—a body without chest or shoulders.
An immense forehead, which seemed to have engulfed the rest of the man, expanded like a dome above a thin face which ended in a little pointed beard.
Two sharp eyes and a peculiar mouth gave one the impression of the head of a reptile, while the magnificent brow suggested a genius.
A nervous twitching shook this peculiar being, who walked, moved, acted by jerks like a broken spring.
This was Algernon Charles Swinburne, son of an English admiral and grandson, on the maternal side, of the Earl of Ashburnham.
He strange countenance was transfigured when he spoke.
I have seldom seen a man more impressive, more eloquent, incisive or charming in conversation.
His rapid, clear, piercing and fantastic imagination seemed to creep into his voice and to lend life to his words.
His brusque gestures enlivened his speech, which penetrated one like a dagger, and he had bursts of thought, just as lighthouses throw out flashes of fire, great, genial lights that seemed to illuminate a whole world of ideas.
The home of the two friends was pretty and by no means commonplace.
Everywhere were paintings, some superb, some strange, representing different conceptions of insanity.
Unless I am mistaken, there was a water-color which represented the head of a dead man floating in a rose-colored shell on a boundless ocean, under a moon with a human face.
Here and there I came across bones.
I clearly remember a flayed hand on which was hanging some dried skin and black muscles, and on the snow-white bones could be seen the traces of dried blood.
The food was a riddle which I could not solve.
Was it good?
Was it bad?
I could not say.
Some roast monkey took away all desire to make a steady diet of this animal, and the great monkey who roamed about among us at large and playfully pushed his head into my glass when I wished to drink cured me of any desire I might have to take one of his brothers as a companion for the rest of my days.
As for the two men, they gave me the impression of two strange, original, remarkable minds, belonging to that peculiar race of talented madmen from among whom have arisen Poe, Hoffmann and many others.
If genius is, as is commonly believed, a sort of aberration of great minds, then Algernon Charles Swinburne is undoubtedly a genius.
Great minds that are healthy are never considered geniuses, while this sublime qualification is lavished on brains that are often inferior but are slightly touched by madness.
At any rate, this poet remains one of the first of his time, through his originality and polished form.
He is an exalted lyrical singer who seldom bothers about the good and humble truth, which French poets are now seeking so persistently and patiently.
He strives to set down dreams, subtle thoughts, sometimes great, sometimes visibly forced, but sometimes magnificent.
Two years later I found the house closed and its tenants gone.
The furniture was being sold.
In memory of them I bought the hideous flayed hand.
On the grass an enormous square block of granite bore this simple word: "Nip."
Above this a hollow stone offered water to the birds.
It was the grave of the monkey, who had been hanged by a young, vindictive negro servant.
It was said that this violent domestic had been forced to flee at the point of his exasperated master's revolver.
After wandering about without home or food for several days, he returned and began to peddle barley-sugar in the streets.
He was expelled from the country after he had almost strangled a displeased customer.
The world would be gayer if one could often meet homes like that
==========
It was a men's dinner party, and they were sitting over their cigars and brandy and discussing magnetism.
Donato's tricks and Charcot's experiments.
Presently, the sceptical, easy-going men, who cared nothing for religion of any sort, began telling stories of strange occurrences, incredible things which, nevertheless, had really occurred, so they said, falling back into superstitious beliefs, clinging to these last remnants of the marvellous, becoming devotees of this mystery of magnetism, defending it in the name of science.
There was only one person who smiled, a vigorous young fellow, a great ladies' man who was so incredulous that he would not even enter upon a discussion of such matters.
He repeated with a sneer:
"Humbug!
humbug!
humbug!
We need not discuss Donato, who is merely a very smart juggler.
As for M. Charcot, who is said to be a remarkable man of science, he produces on me the effect of those story-tellers of the school of Edgar Poe, who end by going mad through constantly reflecting on queer cases of insanity.
He has authenticated some cases of unexplained and inexplicable nervous phenomena; he makes his way into that unknown region which men are exploring every day, and unable always to understand what he sees, he recalls, perhaps, the ecclesiastical interpretation of these mysteries.
I should like to hear what he says himself."
The words of the unbeliever were listened to with a kind of pity, as if he had blasphemed in an assembly of monks.
One of these gentlemen exclaimed:
"And yet miracles were performed in olden times."
"I deny it," replied the other: "Why cannot they be performed now?"
Then, each mentioned some fact, some fantastic presentiment some instance of souls communicating with each other across space, or some case of the secret influence of one being over another.
They asserted and maintained that these things had actually occurred, while the sceptic angrily repeated:
"Humbug!
humbug!
humbug!"
At last he rose, threw away his cigar, and with his hands in his pockets, said: "Well, I also have two stories to tell you, which I will afterwards explain.
Here they are:
"In the little village of Etretat, the men, who are all seafaring folk, go every year to Newfoundland to fish for cod.
One night the little son of one of these fishermen woke up with a start, crying out that his father was dead.
The child was quieted, and again he woke up exclaiming that his father was drowned.
A month later the news came that his father had, in fact, been swept off the deck of his smack by a billow.
The widow then remembered how her son had woke up and spoken of his father's death.
Everyone said it was a miracle, and the affair caused a great sensation.
The dates were compared, and it was found that the accident and the dream were almost coincident, whence they concluded that they had happened on the same night and at the same hour.
And there is a mystery of magnetism."
The story-teller stopped suddenly.
Thereupon, one of those who had heard him, much affected by the narrative, asked:
"And can you explain this?"
"Perfectly, monsieur.
I have discovered the secret.
The circumstance surprised me and even perplexed me very much; but you see, I do not believe on principle.
Just as others begin by believing, I begin by doubting; and when I cannot understand, I continue to deny that there can be any telepathic communication between souls; certain that my own intelligence will be able to explain it.
Well, I kept on inquiring into the matter, and by dint of questioning all the wives of the absent seamen, I was convinced that not a week passed without one of them, or one of their children dreaming and declaring when they woke up that the father was drowned.
The horrible and continual fear of this accident makes them always talk about it.
Now, if one of these frequent predictions coincides, by a very simple chance, with the death of the person referred to, people at once declare it to be a miracle; for they suddenly lose sight of all the other predictions of misfortune that have remained unfulfilled.
I have myself known fifty cases where the persons who made the prediction forgot all about it a week after wards.
But, if, then one happens to die, then the recollection of the thing is immediately revived, and people are ready to believe in the intervention of God, according to some, and magnetism, according to others."
One of the smokers remarked:
"What you say is right enough; but what about your second story?"
"Oh!
my second story is a very delicate matter to relate.
It happened to myself, and so I don't place any great value on my own view of the matter.
An interested party can never give an impartial opinion.
However, here it is:
"Among my acquaintances was a young woman on whom I had never bestowed a thought, whom I had never even looked at attentively, never taken any notice of.
"I classed her among the women of no importance, though she was not bad-looking; she appeared, in fact, to possess eyes, a nose, a mouth, some sort of hair—just a colorless type of countenance.
She was one of those beings who awaken only a chance, passing thought, but no special interest, no desire.
"Well, one night, as I was writing some letters by my fireside before going to bed, I was conscious, in the midst of that train of sensuous visions that sometimes pass through one's brain in moments of idle reverie, of a kind of slight influence, passing over me, a little flutter of the heart, and immediately, without any cause, without any logical connection of thought, I saw distinctly, as if I were touching her, saw from head to foot, and disrobed, this young woman to whom I had never given more that three seconds' thought at a time.
I suddenly discovered in her a number of qualities which I had never before observed, a sweet charm, a languorous fascination; she awakened in me that sort of restless emotion that causes one to pursue a woman.
But I did not think of her long.
I went to bed and was soon asleep.
And I dreamed.
"You have all had these strange dreams which make you overcome the impossible, which open to you double-locked doors, unexpected joys, tightly folded arms?
"Which of us in these troubled, excising, breathless slumbers, has not held, clasped, embraced with rapture, the woman who occupied his thoughts?
And have you ever noticed what superhuman delight these happy dreams give us?
Into what mad intoxication they cast you!
with what passionate spasms they shake you!
and with what infinite, caressing, penetrating tenderness they fill your heart for her whom you hold clasped in your arms in that adorable illusion that is so like reality!
"All this I felt with unforgettable violence.
This woman was mine, so much mine that the pleasant warmth of her skin remained in my fingers, the odor of her skin, in my brain, the taste of her kisses, on my lips, the sound of her voice lingered in my ears, the touch of her clasp still clung to me, and the burning charm of her tenderness still gratified my senses long after the delight but disillusion of my awakening.
"And three times that night I had the same dream.
"When the day dawned she haunted me, possessed me, filled my senses to such an extent that I was not one second without thinking of her.
"At last, not knowing what to do, I dressed myself and went to call on her.
As I went upstairs to her apartment, I was so overcome by emotion that I trembled, and my heart beat rapidly.
"I entered the apartment.
She rose the moment she heard my name mentioned; and suddenly our eyes met in a peculiar fixed gaze.
"I sat down.
I stammered out some commonplaces which she seemed not to hear.
I did not know what to say or do.
Then, abruptly, clasping my arms round her, my dream was realized so suddenly that I began to doubt whether I was really awake.
We were friends after this for two years."
"What conclusion do you draw from it?"
said a voice.
The story-teller seemed to hesitate.
"The conclusion I draw from it—well, by Jove, the conclusion is that it was just a coincidence!
And then—who can tell?
==========
All Veziers-le-Rethel had followed the funeral procession of M. Badon-Leremince to the grave, and the last words of the funeral oration pronounced by the delegate of the district remained in the minds of all: "He was an honest man, at least!"
An honest man he had been in all the known acts of his life, in his words, in his examples, his attitude, his behavior, his enterprises, in the cut of his beard and the shape of his hats.
He never had said a word that did not set an example, never had given an alms without adding a word of advice, never had extended his hand without appearing to bestow a benediction.
He left two children, a boy and a girl.
His son was counselor general, and his daughter, having married a lawyer, M. Poirel de la Voulte, moved in the best society of Veziers.
They were inconsolable at the death of their father, for they loved him sincerely.
As soon as the ceremony was over, the son, daughter and son-in-law returned to the house of mourning, and, shutting themselves in the library, they opened the will, the seals of which were to be broken by them alone and only after the coffin had been placed in the ground.
This wish was expressed by a notice on the envelope.
M. Poirel de la Voulte tore open the envelope, in his character of a lawyer used to such operations, and having adjusted his spectacles, he read in a monotonous voice, made for reading the details of contracts:
M. Poirel de la Voulte raised his spectacles with a motion that was peculiar to him whenever he finished reading a contract; and the three heirs of the defunct looked at one another without speaking, pale and motionless.
At the end of a minute the lawyer resumed:
"That must be destroyed."
The other two bent their heads in sign of assent.
He lighted a candle, carefully separated the pages containing the damaging confession from those relating to the disposition of money, then he held them over the candle and threw them into the fireplace.
And they watched the white sheets as they burned, till they were presently reduced to little crumbling black heaps.
And as some words were still visible in white tracing, the daughter, with little strokes of the toe of her shoe, crushed the burning paper, mixing it with the old ashes in the fireplace.
Then all three stood there watching it for some time, as if they feared that the destroyed secret might escape from the fireplace
==========
I recalled this horrible story, the events of which occurred long ago, and this horrible woman, the other day at a fashionable seaside resort, where I saw on the beach a well-known young, elegant and charming Parisienne, adored and respected by everyone.
I had been invited by a friend to pay him a visit in a little provincial town.
He took me about in all directions to do the honors of the place, showed me noted scenes, chateaux, industries, ruins.
He pointed out monuments, churches, old carved doorways, enormous or distorted trees, the oak of St. Andrew, and the yew tree of Roqueboise.
When I had exhausted my admiration and enthusiasm over all the sights, my friend said with a distressed expression on his face, that there was nothing left to look at.
I breathed freely.
I would now be able to rest under the shade of the trees.
But, all at once, he uttered an exclamation:
"Oh, yes!
We have the 'Mother of Monsters'; I must take you to see her."
"Who is that, the 'Mother of Monsters'?"
I asked.
"She is an abominable woman," he replied, "a regular demon, a being who voluntarily brings into the world deformed, hideous, frightful children, monstrosities, in fact, and then sells them to showmen who exhibit such things.
"These exploiters of freaks come from time to time to find out if she has any fresh monstrosity, and if it meets with their approval they carry it away with them, paying the mother a compensation.
"She has eleven of this description.
She is rich.
"You think I am joking, romancing, exaggerating.
No, my friend; I am telling you the truth, the exact truth.
"Let us go and see this woman.
Then I will tell you her history."
He took me into one of the suburbs.
The woman lived in a pretty little house by the side of the road.
It was attractive and well kept.
The garden was filled with fragrant flowers.
One might have supposed it to be the residence of a retired lawyer.
A maid ushered us into a sort of little country parlor, and the wretch appeared.
She was about forty.
She was a tall, big woman with hard features, but well formed, vigorous and healthy, the true type of a robust peasant woman, half animal, and half woman.
She was aware of her reputation and received everyone with a humility that smacked of hatred.
"What do the gentlemen wish?"
she asked.
"They tell me that your last child is just like an ordinary child, that he does not resemble his brothers at all," replied my friend.
"I wanted to be sure of that.
Is it true?"
She cast on us a malicious and furious look as she said:
"Oh, no, oh, no, my poor sir!
He is perhaps even uglier than the rest.
I have no luck, no luck!
"They are all like that, it is heartbreaking!
How can the good God be so hard on a poor woman who is all alone in the world, how can He?"
She spoke hurriedly, her eyes cast down, with a deprecating air as of a wild beast who is afraid.
Her harsh voice became soft, and it seemed strange to hear those tearful falsetto tones issuing from that big, bony frame, of unusual strength and with coarse outlines, which seemed fitted for violent action, and made to utter howls like a wolf.
"We should like to see your little one," said my friend.
I fancied she colored up.
I may have been deceived.
After a few moments of silence, she said in a louder tone:
"What good will that do you?"
"Why do you not wish to show it to us?"
replied my friend.
"There are many people to whom you will show it; you know whom I mean."
She gave a start, and resuming her natural voice, and giving free play to her anger, she screamed:
"Was that why you came here?
To insult me?
Because my children are like animals, tell me?
You shall not see him, no, no, you shall not see him!
Go away, go away!
I do not know why you all try to torment me like that."
She walked over toward us, her hands on her hips.
At the brutal tone of her voice, a sort of moaning, or rather a mewing, the lamentable cry of an idiot, came from the adjoining room.
I shivered to the marrow of my bones.
We retreated before her.
"Take care, Devil," (they called her the Devil), said my friend, "take care; some day you will get yourself into trouble through this."
She began to tremble, beside herself with fury, shaking her fist and roaring:
"Be off with you!
What will get me into trouble?
Be off with you, miscreants!"
She was about to attack us, but we fled, saddened at what we had seen.
When we got outside, my friend said:
"Well, you have seen her, what do you think of her?"
"Tell me the story of this brute," I replied.
And this is what he told me as we walked along the white high road, with ripe crops on either side of it which rippled like the sea in the light breeze that passed over them.
"This woman was one a servant on a farm.
She was an honest girl, steady and economical.
She was never known to have an admirer, and never suspected of any frailty.
But she went astray, as so many do.
"She soon found herself in trouble, and was tortured with fear and shame.
Wishing to conceal her misfortune, she bound her body tightly with a corset of her own invention, made of boards and cord.
The more she developed, the more she bound herself with this instrument of torture, suffering martyrdom, but brave in her sorrow, not allowing anyone to see, or suspect, anything.
She maimed the little unborn being, cramping it with that frightful corset, and made a monster of it.
Its head was squeezed and elongated to a point, and its large eyes seemed popping out of its head.
Its limbs, exaggeratedly long, and twisted like the stalk of a vine, terminated in fingers like the claws of a spider.
Its trunk was tiny, and round as a nut.
"The child was born in an open field, and when the weeders saw it, they fled away, screaming, and the report spread that she had given birth to a demon.
From that time on, she was called 'the Devil.'
"She was driven from the farm, and lived on charity, under a cloud.
She brought up the monster, whom she hated with a savage hatred, and would have strangled, perhaps, if the priest had not threatened her with arrest.
"One day some travelling showmen heard about the frightful creature, and asked to see it, so that if it pleased them they might take it away.
They were pleased, and counted out five hundred francs to the mother.
At first, she had refused to let them see the little animal, as she was ashamed; but when she discovered it had a money value, and that these people were anxious to get it, she began to haggle with them, raising her price with all a peasant's persistence.
"She made them draw up a paper, in which they promised to pay her four hundred francs a year besides, as though they had taken this deformity into their employ.
"Incited by the greed of gain, she continued to produce these phenomena, so as to have an assured income like a bourgeoise.
"Some of them were long, some short, some like crabs-all bodies-others like lizards.
Several died, and she was heartbroken.
"The law tried to interfere, but as they had no proof they let her continue to produce her freaks.
"She has at this moment eleven alive, and they bring in, on an average, counting good and bad years, from five to six thousand francs a year.
One, alone, is not placed, the one she was unwilling to show us.
But she will not keep it long, for she is known to all the showmen in the world, who come from time to time to see if she has anything new.
"She even gets bids from them when the monster is valuable."
My friend was silent.
A profound disgust stirred my heart, and a feeling of rage, of regret, to think that I had not strangled this brute when I had the opportunity.
I had forgotten this story, when I saw on the beach of a fashionable resort the other day, an elegant, charming, dainty woman, surrounded by men who paid her respect as well as admiration.
I was walking along the beach, arm in arm with a friend, the resident physician.
Ten minutes later, I saw a nursemaid with three children, who were rolling in the sand.
A pair of little crutches lay on the ground, and touched my sympathy.
I then noticed that these three children were all deformed, humpbacked, or crooked; and hideous.
"Those are the offspring of that charming woman you saw just now," said the doctor.
I was filled with pity for her, as well as for them, and exclaimed: "Oh, the poor mother!
How can she ever laugh!"
"Do not pity her, my friend.
Pity the poor children," replied the doctor.
"This is the consequence of preserving a slender figure up to the last.
These little deformities were made by the corset.
She knows very well that she is risking her life at this game.
But what does she care, as long as he can be beautiful and have admirers!"
And then I recalled that other woman, the peasant, the "Devil," who sold her children, her monsters
==========
One autumn I went to spend the hunting season with some friends in a chateau in Picardy.
My friends were fond of practical jokes.
I do not care to know people who are not.
When I arrived, they gave me a princely reception, which at once awakened suspicion in my mind.
They fired off rifles, embraced me, made much of me, as if they expected to have great fun at my expense.
I said to myself:
"Look out, old ferret!
They have something in store for you."
During the dinner the mirth was excessive, exaggerated, in fact.
I thought: "Here are people who have more than their share of amusement, and apparently without reason.
They must have planned some good joke.
Assuredly I am to be the victim of the joke.
Attention!"
During the entire evening every one laughed in an exaggerated fashion.
I scented a practical joke in the air, as a dog scents game.
But what was it?
I was watchful, restless.
I did not let a word, or a meaning, or a gesture escape me.
Every one seemed to me an object of suspicion, and I even looked distrustfully at the faces of the servants.
The hour struck for retiring; and the whole household came to escort me to my room.
Why?
They called to me: "Good-night."
I entered the apartment, shut the door, and remained standing, without moving a single step, holding the wax candle in my hand.
I heard laughter and whispering in the corridor.
Without doubt they were spying on me.
I cast a glance round the walls, the furniture, the ceiling, the hangings, the floor.
I saw nothing to justify suspicion.
I heard persons moving about outside my door.
I had no doubt they were looking through the keyhole.
An idea came into my head: "My candle may suddenly go out and leave me in darkness."
Then I went across to the mantelpiece and lighted all the wax candles that were on it.
After that I cast another glance around me without discovering anything.
I advanced with short steps, carefully examining the apartment.
Nothing.
I inspected every article, one after the other.
Still nothing.
I went over to the window.
The shutters, large wooden shutters, were open.
I shut them with great care, and then drew the curtains, enormous velvet curtains, and placed a chair in front of them, so as to have nothing to fear from outside.
Then I cautiously sat down.
The armchair was solid.
I did not venture to get into the bed.
However, the night was advancing; and I ended by coming to the conclusion that I was foolish.
If they were spying on me, as I supposed, they must, while waiting for the success of the joke they had been preparing for me, have been laughing immoderately at my terror.
So I made up my mind to go to bed.
But the bed was particularly suspicious-looking.
I pulled at the curtains.
They seemed to be secure.
All the same, there was danger.
I was going perhaps to receive a cold shower both from overhead, or perhaps, the moment I stretched myself out, to find myself sinking to the floor with my mattress.
I searched in my memory for all the practical jokes of which I ever had experience.
And I did not want to be caught.
Ah!
certainly not!
certainly not!
Then I suddenly bethought myself of a precaution which I considered insured safety.
I caught hold of the side of the mattress gingerly, and very slowly drew it toward me.
It came away, followed by the sheet and the rest of the bedclothes.
I dragged all these objects into the very middle of the room, facing the entrance door.
I made my bed over again as best I could at some distance from the suspected bedstead and the corner which had filled me with such anxiety.
Then I extinguished all the candles, and, groping my way, I slipped under the bed clothes.
For at least another hour I remained awake, starting at the slightest sound.
Everything seemed quiet in the chateau.
I fell asleep.
I must have been in a deep sleep for a long time, but all of a sudden I was awakened with a start by the fall of a heavy body tumbling right on top of my own, and, at the same time, I received on my face, on my neck, and on my chest a burning liquid which made me utter a howl of pain.
And a dreadful noise, as if a sideboard laden with plates and dishes had fallen down, almost deafened me.
I was smothering beneath the weight that was crushing me and preventing me from moving.
I stretched out my hand to find out what was the nature of this object.
I felt a face, a nose, and whiskers.
Then, with all my strength, I launched out a blow at this face.
But I immediately received a hail of cuffings which made me jump straight out of the soaked sheets, and rush in my nightshirt into the corridor, the door of which I found open.
Oh, heavens!
it was broad daylight.
The noise brought my friends hurrying into my apartment, and we found, sprawling over my improvised bed, the dismayed valet, who, while bringing me my morning cup of tea, had tripped over this obstacle in the middle of the floor and fallen on his stomach, spilling my breakfast over my face in spite of himself.
The precautions I had taken in closing the shutters and going to sleep in the middle of the room had only brought about the practical joke I had been trying to avoid.
Oh, how they all laughed that day!
==========
"Hello!
there's Milial!"
said somebody near me.
I looked at the man who had been pointed out as I had been wishing for a long time to meet this Don Juan.
He was no longer young.
His gray hair looked a little like those fur bonnets worn by certain Northern peoples, and his long beard, which fell down over his chest, had also somewhat the appearance of fur.
He was talking to a lady, leaning toward her, speaking in a low voice and looking at her with an expression full of respect and tenderness.
I knew his life, or at least as much as was known of it.
He had loved madly several times, and there had been certain tragedies with which his name had been connected.
When I spoke to women who were the loudest in his praise, and asked them whence came this power, they always answered, after thinking for a while: "I don't know—he has a certain charm about him."
He was certainly not handsome.
He had none of the elegance that we ascribe to conquerors of feminine hearts.
I wondered what might be his hid den charm.
Was it mental?
I never had heard of a clever saying of his.
In his glance?
Perhaps.
Or in his voice?
The voices of some beings have a certain irresistible attraction, almost suggesting the flavor of things good to eat.
One is hungry for them, and the sound of their words penetrates us like a dainty morsel.
A friend was passing.
I asked him: "Do you know Monsieur Milial?"
"Yes."
"Introduce us."
A minute later we were shaking hands and talking in the doorway.
What he said was correct, agreeable to hear; it contained no irritable thought.
The voice was sweet, soft, caressing, musical; but I had heard others much more attractive, much more moving.
One listened to him with pleasure, just as one would look at a pretty little brook.
No tension of the mind was necessary in order to follow him, no hidden meaning aroused curiosity, no expectation awoke interest.
His conversation was rather restful, but it did not awaken in one either a desire to answer, to contradict or to approve, and it was as easy to answer him as it was to listen to him.
The response came to the lips of its own accord, as soon as he had finished talking, and phrases turned toward him as if he had naturally aroused them.
One thought soon struck me.
I had known him for a quarter of an hour, and it seemed as if he were already one of my old friends, that I had known all about him for a long time; his face, his gestures, his voice, his ideas.
Suddenly, after a few minutes of conversation, he seemed already to be installed in my intimacy.
All constraint disappeared between us, and, had he so desired, I might have confided in him as one confides only in old friends.
Certainly there was some mystery about him.
Those barriers that are closed between most people and that are lowered with time when sympathy, similar tastes, equal intellectual culture and constant intercourse remove constraint—those barriers seemed not to exist between him and me, and no doubt this was the case between him and all people, both men and women, whom fate threw in his path.
After half an hour we parted, promising to see each other often, and he gave me his address after inviting me to take luncheon with him in two days.
I forgot what hour he had stated, and I arrived too soon; he was not yet home.
A correct and silent domestic showed me into a beautiful, quiet, softly lighted parlor.
I felt comfortable there, at home.
How often I have noticed the influence of apartments on the character and on the mind!
There are some which make one feel foolish; in others, on the contrary, one always feels lively.
Some make us sad, although well lighted and decorated in light-colored furniture; others cheer us up, although hung with sombre material.
Our eye, like our heart, has its likes and dislikes, of which it does not inform us, and which it secretly imposes on our temperament.
The harmony of furniture, walls, the style of an ensemble, act immediately on our mental state, just as the air from the woods, the sea or the mountains modifies our physical natures.
I sat down on a cushion-covered divan and felt myself suddenly carried and supported by these little silk bags of feathers, as if the outline of my body had been marked out beforehand on this couch.
Then I looked about.
There was nothing striking about the room; every-where were beautiful and modest things, simple and rare furniture, Oriental curtains which did not seem to come from a department store but from the interior of a harem; and exactly opposite me hung the portrait of a woman.
It was a portrait of medium size, showing the head and the upper part of the body, and the hands, which were holding a book.
She was young, bareheaded; ribbons were woven in her hair; she was smiling sadly.
Was it because she was bareheaded, was it merely her natural expression?
I never have seen a portrait of a lady which seemed so much in its place as that one in that dwelling.
Of all those I knew I have seen nothing like that one.
All those that I know are on exhibition, whether the lady be dressed in her gaudiest gown, with an attractive headdress and a look which shows that she is posing first of all before the artist and then before those who will look at her or whether they have taken a comfortable attitude in an ordinary gown.
Some are standing majestically in all their beauty, which is not at all natural to them in life.
All of them have something, a flower or, a jewel, a crease in the dress or a curve of the lip, which one feels to have been placed there for effect by the artist.
Whether they wear a hat or merely their hair one can immediately notice that they are not entirely natural.
Why?
One cannot say without knowing them, but the effect is there.
They seem to be calling somewhere, on people whom they wish to please and to whom they wish to appear at their best advantage; and they have studied their attitudes, sometimes modest, Sometimes haughty.
What could one say about this one?
She was at home and alone.
Yes, she was alone, for she was smiling as one smiles when thinking in solitude of something sad or sweet, and not as one smiles when one is being watched.
She seemed so much alone and so much at home that she made the whole large apartment seem absolutely empty.
She alone lived in it, filled it, gave it life.
Many people might come in and converse, laugh, even sing; she would still be alone with a solitary smile, and she alone would give it life with her pictured gaze.
That look also was unique.
It fell directly on me, fixed and caressing, without seeing me.
All portraits know that they are being watched, and they answer with their eyes, which see, think, follow us without leaving us, from the very moment we enter the apartment they inhabit.
This one did not see me; it saw nothing, although its look was fixed directly on me.
I remembered the surprising verse of Baudelaire:
And your eyes, attractive as those of a portrait.
They did indeed attract me in an irresistible manner; those painted eyes which had lived, or which were perhaps still living, threw over me a strange, powerful spell.
Oh, what an infinite and tender charm, like a passing breeze, like a dying sunset of lilac rose and blue, a little sad like the approaching night, which comes behind the sombre frame and out of those impenetrable eyes!
Those eyes, created by a few strokes from a brush, hide behind them the mystery of that which seems to be and which does not exist, which can appear in the eyes of a woman, which can make love blossom within us.
The door opened and M. Milial entered.
He excused himself for being late.
I excused myself for being ahead of time.
Then I said: "Might I ask you who is this lady?"
He answered: "That is my mother.
She died very young."
Then I understood whence came the inexplicable attraction of this man
==========
The north wind was blowing a hurricane, driving through the sky big, black, heavy clouds from which the rain poured down on the earth with terrific violence.
A high sea was raging and dashing its huge, slow, foamy waves along the coast with the rumbling sound of thunder.
The waves followed each other close, rolling in as high as mountains, scattering the foam as they broke.
The storm engulfed itself in the little valley of Yport, whistling and moaning, tearing the shingles from the roofs, smashing the shutters, knocking down the chimneys, rushing through the narrow streets in such gusts that one could walk only by holding on to the walls, and children would have been lifted up like leaves and carried over the houses into the fields.
The fishing smacks had been hauled high up on land, because at high tide the sea would sweep the beach.
Several sailors, sheltered behind the curved bottoms of their boats, were watching this battle of the sky and the sea.
Then, one by one, they went away, for night was falling on the storm, wrapping in shadows the raging ocean and all the battling elements.
Just two men remained, their hands plunged deep into their pockets, bending their backs beneath the squall, their woolen caps pulled down over their ears; two big Normandy fishermen, bearded, their skin tanned through exposure, with the piercing black eyes of the sailor who looks over the horizon like a bird of prey.
One of them was saying:
"Come on, Jeremie, let's go play dominoes.
It's my treat."
The other hesitated a while, tempted on one hand by the game and the thought of brandy, knowing well that, if he went to Paumelle's, he would return home drunk; held back, on the other hand, by the idea of his wife remaining alone in the house.
He asked:
"Any one might think that you had made a bet to get me drunk every night.
Say, what good is it doing you, since it's always you that's treating?"
Nevertheless he was smiling at the idea of all this brandy drunk at the expense of another.
He was smiling the contented smirk of an avaricious Norman.
Mathurin, his friend, kept pulling him by the sleeve.
"Come on, Jeremie.
This isn't the kind of a night to go home without anything to warm you up.
What are you afraid of?
Isn't your wife going to warm your bed for you?"
Jeremie answered:
"The other night I couldn't find the door—I had to be fished out of the ditch in front of the house!"
He was still laughing at this drunkard's recollection, and he was unconsciously going toward Paumelle's Cafe, where a light was shining in the window; he was going, pulled by Mathurin and pushed by the wind, unable to resist these combined forces.
The low room was full of sailors, smoke and noise.
All these men, clad in woolens, their elbows on the tables, were shouting to make themselves heard.
The more people came in, the more one had to shout in order to overcome the noise of voices and the rattling of dominoes on the marble tables.
Jeremie and Mathurin sat down in a corner and began a game, and the glasses were emptied in rapid succession into their thirsty throats.
Then they played more games and drank more glasses.
Mathurin kept pouring and winking to the saloon keeper, a big, red-faced man, who chuckled as though at the thought of some fine joke; and Jeremie kept absorbing alcohol and wagging his head, giving vent to a roar of laughter and looking at his comrade with a stupid and contented expression.
All the customers were going away.
Every time that one of them would open the door to leave a gust of wind would blow into the cafe, making the tobacco smoke swirl around, swinging the lamps at the end of their chains and making their flames flicker, and suddenly one could hear the deep booming of a breaking wave and the moaning of the wind.
Jeremie, his collar unbuttoned, was taking drunkard's poses, one leg outstretched, one arm hanging down and in the other hand holding a domino.
They were alone now with the owner, who had come up to them, interested.
He asked:
"Well, Jeremie, how goes it inside?
Feel less thirsty after wetting your throat?"
Jeremie muttered:
"The more I wet it, the drier it gets inside."
The innkeeper cast a sly glance at Mathurin.
He said:
"And your brother, Mathurin, where's he now?"
The sailor laughed silently:
"Don't worry; he's warm, all right."
And both of them looked toward Jeremie, who was triumphantly putting down the double six and announcing:
"Game!"
Then the owner declared:
"Well, boys, I'm goin' to bed.
I will leave you the lamp and the bottle; there's twenty cents' worth in it.
Lock the door when you go, Mathurin, and slip the key under the mat the way you did the other night."
Mathurin answered:
"Don't worry; it'll be all right."
Paumelle shook hands with his two customers and slowly went up the wooden stairs.
For several minutes his heavy step echoed through the little house.
Then a loud creaking announced that he had got into bed.
The two men continued to play.
From time to time a more violent gust of wind would shake the whole house, and the two drinkers would look up, as though some one were about to enter.
Then Mathurin would take the bottle and fill Jeremie's glass.
But suddenly the clock over the bar struck twelve.
Its hoarse clang sounded like the rattling of saucepans.
Then Mathurin got up like a sailor whose watch is over.
"Come on, Jeremie, we've got to get out."
The other man rose to his feet with difficulty, got his balance by leaning on the table, reached the door and opened it while his companion was putting out the light.
As soon as they were in the street Mathurin locked the door and then said:
"Well, so long.
See you to-morrow night!"
And he disappeared in the darkness.
Jeremie took a few steps, staggered, stretched out his hands, met a wall which supported him and began to stumble along.
From time to time a gust of wind would sweep through the street, pushing him forward, making him run for a few steps; then, when the wind would die down, he would stop short, having lost his impetus, and once more he would begin to stagger on his unsteady drunkard's legs.
He went instinctively toward his home, just as birds go to their nests.
Finally he recognized his door, and began to feel about for the keyhole and tried to put the key in it.
Not finding the hole, he began to swear.
Then he began to beat on the door with his fists, calling for his wife to come and help him:
"Melina!
Oh, Melina!"
As he leaned against the door for support, it gave way and opened, and Jeremie, losing his prop, fell inside, rolling on his face into the middle of his room, and he felt something heavy pass over him and escape in the night.
He was no longer moving, dazed by fright, bewildered, fearing the devil, ghosts, all the mysterious beings of darkness, and he waited a long time without daring to move.
But when he found out that nothing else was moving, a little reason returned to him, the reason of a drunkard.
Gently he sat up.
Again he waited a long time, and at last, growing bolder, he called:
"Melina!"
His wife did not answer.
Then, suddenly, a suspicion crossed his darkened mind, an indistinct, vague suspicion.
He was not moving; he was sitting there in the dark, trying to gather together his scattered wits, his mind stumbling over incomplete ideas, just as his feet stumbled along.
Once more he asked:
"Who was it, Melina?
Tell me who it was.
I won't hurt you!"
He waited, no voice was raised in the darkness.
He was now reasoning with himself out loud.
"I'm drunk, all right!
I'm drunk!
And he filled me up, the dog; he did it, to stop my goin' home.
I'm drunk!"
And he would continue:
"Tell me who it was, Melina, or somethin'll happen to you."
After having waited again, he went on with the slow and obstinate logic of a drunkard:
"He's been keeping me at that loafer Paumelle's place every night, so as to stop my going home.
It's some trick.
Oh, you damned carrion!"
Slowly he got on his knees.
A blind fury was gaining possession of him, mingling with the fumes of alcohol.
He continued:
"Tell me who it was, Melina, or you'll get a licking—I warn you!"
He was now standing, trembling with a wild fury, as though the alcohol had set his blood on fire.
He took a step, knocked against a chair, seized it, went on, reached the bed, ran his hands over it and felt the warm body of his wife.
Then, maddened, he roared:
"So!
You were there, you piece of dirt, and you wouldn't answer!"
And, lifting the chair, which he was holding in his strong sailor's grip, he swung it down before him with an exasperated fury.
A cry burst from the bed, an agonizing, piercing cry.
Then he began to thrash around like a thresher in a barn.
And soon nothing more moved.
The chair was broken to pieces, but he still held one leg and beat away with it, panting.
At last he stopped to ask:
"Well, are you ready to tell me who it was?"
Melina did not answer.
Then tired out, stupefied from his exertion, he stretched himself out on the ground and slept.
When day came a neighbor, seeing the door open, entered.
He saw Jeremie snoring on the floor, amid the broken pieces of a chair, and on the bed a pulp of flesh and blood
==========
As we sat chatting after dinner, a party of men, the conversation turned on women, for lack of something else.
One of us said:
"Here's a funny thing that happened to me on, that very subject."
And he told us the following story:
One evening last winter I suddenly felt overcome by that overpowering sense of misery and languor that takes possession of one from time to time.
I was in my own apartment, all alone, and I was convinced that if I gave in to my feelings I should have a terrible attack of melancholia, one of those attacks that lead to suicide when they recur too often.
I put on my overcoat and went out without the slightest idea of what I was going to do.
Having gone as far as the boulevards, I began to wander along by the almost empty cafes.
It was raining, a fine rain that affects your mind as it does your clothing, not one of those good downpours which come down in torrents, driving breathless passers-by into doorways, but a rain without drops that deposits on your clothing an imperceptible spray and soon covers you with a sort of iced foam that chills you through.
What should I do?
I walked in one direction and then came back, looking for some place where I could spend two hours, and discovering for the first time that there is no place of amusement in Paris in the evening.
At last I decided to go to the Folies-Bergere, that entertaining resort for gay women.
There were very few people in the main hall.
In the long horseshoe curve there were only a few ordinary looking people, whose plebeian origin was apparent in their manners, their clothes, the cut of their hair and beard, their hats, their complexion.
It was rarely that one saw from time to time a man whom you suspected of having washed himself thoroughly, and his whole make-up seemed to match.
As for the women, they were always the same, those frightful women you all know, ugly, tired looking, drooping, and walking along in their lackadaisical manner, with that air of foolish superciliousness which they assume, I do not know why.
I thought to myself that, in truth, not one of those languid creatures, greasy rather than fat, puffed out here and thin there, with the contour of a monk and the lower extremities of a bow-legged snipe, was worth the louis that they would get with great difficulty after asking five.
But all at once I saw a little creature whom I thought attractive, not in her first youth, but fresh, comical and tantalizing.
I stopped her, and stupidly, without thinking, I made an appointment with her for that night.
I did not want to go back to my own home alone, all alone; I preferred the company and the caresses of this hussy.
And I followed her.
She lived in a great big house in the Rue des Martyrs.
The gas was already extinguished on the stairway.
I ascended the steps slowly, lighting a candle match every few seconds, stubbing my foot against the steps, stumbling and angry as I followed the rustle of the skirt ahead of me.
She stopped on the fourth floor, and having closed the outer door she said:
"Then you will stay till to-morrow?"
"Why, yes.
You know that that was the agreement."
"All right, my dear, I just wanted to know.
Wait for me here a minute, I will be right back."
And she left me in the darkness.
I heard her shutting two doors and then I thought I heard her talking.
I was surprised and uneasy.
The thought that she had a protector staggered me.
But I have good fists and a solid back.
"We shall see," I said to myself.
I listened attentively with ear and mind.
Some one was stirring about, walking quietly and very carefully.
Then another door was opened and I thought I again heard some one talking, but in a very low tone.
She came back carrying a lighted candle.
"You may come in," she said.
She said "thou" in speaking to me, which was an indication of possession.
I went in and after passing through a dining room in which it was very evident that no one ever ate, I entered a typical room of all these women, a furnished room with red curtains and a soiled eiderdown bed covering.
"Make yourself at home, 'mon chat'," she said.
I gave a suspicious glance at the room, but there seemed no reason for uneasiness.
As she took off her wraps she began to laugh.
"Well, what ails you?
Are you changed into a pillar of salt?
Come, hurry up."
I did as she suggested.
Five minutes later I longed to put on my things and get away.
But this terrible languor that had overcome me at home took possession of me again, and deprived me of energy enough to move and I stayed in spite of the disgust that I felt for this association.
The unusual attractiveness that I supposed I had discovered in this creature over there under the chandeliers of the theater had altogether vanished on closer acquaintance, and she was nothing more to me now than a common woman, like all the others, whose indifferent and complaisant kiss smacked of garlic.
I thought I would say something.
"Have you lived here long?"
I asked.
"Over six months on the fifteenth of January."
"Where were you before that?"
"In the Rue Clauzel.
But the janitor made me very uncomfortable and I left."
And she began to tell me an interminable story of a janitor who had talked scandal about her.
But, suddenly, I heard something moving quite close to us.
First there was a sigh, then a slight, but distinct, sound as if some one had turned round on a chair.
I sat up abruptly and asked.
"What was that noise?"
She answered quietly and confidently:
"Do not be uneasy, my dear boy, it is my neighbor.
The partition is so thin that one can hear everything as if it were in the room.
These are wretched rooms, just like pasteboard."
I felt so lazy that I paid no further attention to it.
We resumed our conversation.
Driven by the stupid curiosity that prompts all men to question these creatures about their first experiences, to attempt to lift the veil of their first folly, as though to find in them a trace of pristine innocence, to love them, possibly, in a fleeting memory of their candor and modesty of former days, evoked by a word, I insistently asked her about her earlier lovers.
I knew she was telling me lies.
What did it matter?
Among all these lies I might, perhaps, discover something sincere and pathetic.
"Come," said I, "tell me who he was."
"He was a boating man, my dear."
"Ah!
Tell me about it.
Where were you?"
"I was at Argenteuil."
"What were you doing?"
"I was waitress in a restaurant."
"What restaurant?"
"'The Freshwater Sailor.'
Do you know it?"
"I should say so, kept by Bonanfan."
"Yes, that's it."
"And how did he make love to you, this boating man?"
"While I was doing his room.
He took advantage of me."
But I suddenly recalled the theory of a friend of mine, an observant and philosophical physician whom constant attendance in hospitals has brought into daily contact with girl-mothers and prostitutes, with all the shame and all the misery of women, of those poor women who have become the frightful prey of the wandering male with money in his pocket.
"A woman," he said, "is always debauched by a man of her own class and position.
I have volumes of statistics on that subject.
We accuse the rich of plucking the flower of innocence among the girls of the people.
This is not correct.
The rich pay for what they want.
They may gather some, but never for the first time."
Then, turning to my companion, I began to laugh.
"You know that I am aware of your history.
The boating man was not the first."
"Oh, yes, my dear, I swear it:"
"You are lying, my dear."
"Oh, no, I assure you."
"You are lying; come, tell me all."
She seemed to hesitate in astonishment.
I continued:
"I am a sorcerer, my dear girl, I am a clairvoyant.
If you do not tell me the truth, I will go into a trance sleep and then I can find out."
She was afraid, being as stupid as all her kind.
She faltered:
"How did you guess?"
"Come, go on telling me," I said.
"Oh, the first time didn't amount to anything.
"There was a festival in the country.
They had sent for a special chef, M. Alexandre.
As soon as he came he did just as he pleased in the house.
He bossed every one, even the proprietor and his wife, as if he had been a king.
He was a big handsome man, who did not seem fitted to stand beside a kitchen range.
He was always calling out, 'Come, some butter —some eggs—some Madeira!'
And it had to be brought to him at once in a hurry, or he would get cross and say things that would make us blush all over.
"When the day was over he would smoke a pipe outside the door.
And as I was passing by him with a pile of plates he said to me, like that: 'Come, girlie, come down to the water with me and show me the country.'
I went with him like a fool, and we had hardly got down to the bank of the river when he took advantage of me so suddenly that I did not even know what he was doing.
And then he went away on the nine o'clock train.
I never saw him again."
"Is that all?"
I asked.
She hesitated.
"Oh, I think Florentin belongs to him."
"Who is Florentin?"
"My little boy."
"Oh!
Well, then, you made the boating man believe that he was the father, did you not?"
"You bet!"
"Did he have any money, this boating man?"
"Yes, he left me an income of three hundred francs, settled on Florentin."
I was beginning to be amused and resumed:
"All right, my girl, all right.
You are all of you less stupid than one would imagine, all the same.
And how old is he now, Florentin?"
She replied:
"He is now twelve.
He will make his first communion in the spring."
"That is splendid.
And since then you have carried on your business conscientiously?"
She sighed in a resigned manner.
"I must do what I can."
But a loud noise just then coming from the room itself made me start up with a bound.
It sounded like some one falling and picking themselves up again by feeling along the wall with their hands.
I had seized the candle and was looking about me, terrified and furious.
She had risen also and was trying to hold me back to stop me, murmuring:
"That's nothing, my dear, I assure you it's nothing."
But I had discovered what direction the strange noise came from.
I walked straight towards a door hidden at the head of the bed and I opened it abruptly and saw before me, trembling, his bright, terrified eyes opened wide at sight of me, a little pale, thin boy seated beside a large wicker chair off which he had fallen.
As soon as he saw me he began to cry.
Stretching out his arms to his mother, he cried:
"It was not my fault, mamma, it was not my fault.
I was asleep, and I fell off.
Do not scold me, it was not my fault."
I turned to the woman and said:
"What does this mean?"
She seemed confused and worried, and said in a broken voice:
"What do you want me to do?
I do not earn enough to put him to school!
I have to keep him with me, and I cannot afford to pay for another room, by heavens!
He sleeps with me when I am alone.
If any one comes for one hour or two he can stay in the wardrobe; he keeps quiet, he understands it.
But when people stay all night, as you have done, it tires the poor child to sleep on a chair.
"It is not his fault.
I should like to see you sleep all night on a chair—you would have something to say."
She was getting angry and excited and was talking loud.
The child was still crying.
A poor delicate timid little fellow, a veritable child of the wardrobe, of the cold, dark closet, a child who from time to time was allowed to get a little warmth in the bed if it chanced to be unoccupied.
I also felt inclined to cry.
And I went home to my own bed
==========
Spring is a season in which one ought, it seems to me, to drink and eat the landscape.
It is the season of chills, just as autumn is the season of reflection.
In spring the country rouses the physical senses, in autumn it enters into the soul.
I desired this year to breathe the odor of orange blossoms and I set out for the South of France just at the time that every one else was returning home.
I visited Monaco, the shrine of pilgrims, rival of Mecca and Jerusalem, without leaving any gold in any one else's pockets, and I climbed the high mountain beneath a covering of lemon, orange and olive branches.
Have you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower?
The air that one inhales with delight is a quintessence of perfumes.
The strong yet sweet odor, delicious as some dainty, seems to blend with our being, to saturate us, to intoxicate us, to enervate us, to plunge us into a sleepy, dreamy torpor.
As though it were an opium prepared by the hands of fairies and not by those of druggists.
This is a country of ravines.
The surface of the mountains is cleft, hollowed out in all directions, and in these sinuous crevices grow veritable forests of lemon trees.
Here and there where the steep gorge is interrupted by a sort of step, a kind of reservoir has been built which holds the water of the rain storms.
They are large holes with slippery walls with nothing for any one to grasp hold of should they fall in.
I was walking slowly in one of these ascending valleys or gorges, glancing through the foliage at the vivid-hued fruit that remained on the branches.
The narrow gorge made the heavy odor of the flowers still more penetrating; the air seemed to be dense with it.
A feeling of lassitude came over me and I looked for a place to sit down.
A few drops of water glistened in the grass.
I thought that there was a spring near by and I climbed a little further to look for it.
But I only reached the edge of one of these large, deep reservoirs.
I sat down tailor fashion, with my legs crossed under me, and remained there in a reverie before this hole, which looked as if it were filled with ink, so black and stagnant was the liquid it contained.
Down yonder, through the branches, I saw, like patches, bits of the Mediterranean gleaming so that they fairly dazzled my eyes.
But my glance always returned to the immense somber well that appeared to be inhabited by no aquatic animals, so motionless was its surface.
Suddenly a voice made me tremble.
An old gentleman who was picking flowers—this country is the richest in Europe for herbalists—asked me:
"Are you a relation of those poor children, monsieur?"
I looked at him in astonishment.
"What children, monsieur?"
He seemed embarrassed and answered with a bow:
"I beg your pardon.
On seeing you sitting thus absorbed in front of this reservoir I thought you were recalling the frightful tragedy that occurred here."
Now I wanted to know about it, and I begged him to tell me the story.
It is very dismal and very heart-rending, my dear friend, and very trivial at the same time.
It is a simple news item.
I do not know whether to attribute my emotion to the dramatic manner in which the story was told to me, to the setting of the mountains, to the contrast between the joy of the sunlight and the flowers and this black, murderous hole, but my heart was wrung, all my nerves unstrung by this tale which, perhaps, may not appear so terribly harrowing to you as you read it in your room without having the scene of the tragedy before your eyes.
It was one spring in recent years.
Two little boys frequently came to play on the edge of this cistern while their tutor lay under a tree reading a book.
One warm afternoon a piercing cry awoke the tutor who was dozing and the sound of splashing caused by something falling into the water made him jump to his feet abruptly.
The younger of the children, eight years of age, was shouting, as he stood beside the reservoir, the surface of which was stirred and eddying at the spot where the older boy had fallen in as he ran along the stone coping.
Distracted, without waiting or stopping to think what was best to do, the tutor jumped into the black water and did not rise again, having struck his head at the bottom of the cistern.
At the same moment the young boy who had risen to the surface was waving his stretched-out arms toward his brother.
The little fellow on land lay down full length, while the other tried to swim, to approach the wall, and presently the four little hands clasped each other, tightened in each other's grasp, contracted as though they were fastened together.
They both felt the intense joy of an escape from death, a shudder at the danger past.
The older boy tried to climb up to the edge, but could not manage it, as the wall was perpendicular, and his brother, who was too weak, was sliding slowly towards the hole.
Then they remained motionless, filled anew with terror.
And they waited.
The little fellow squeezed his brother's hands with all his might and wept from nervousness as he repeated: "I cannot drag you out, I cannot drag you out."
And all at once he began to shout, "Help!
Help!"
But his light voice scarcely penetrated beyond the dome of foliage above their heads.
They remained thus a long time, hours and hours, facing each other, these two children, with one thought, one anguish of heart and the horrible dread that one of them, exhausted, might let go the hands of the other.
And they kept on calling, but all in vain.
At length the older boy, who was shivering with cold, said to the little one: "I cannot hold out any longer.
I am going to fall.
Good-by, little brother."
And the other, gasping, replied: "Not yet, not yet, wait."
Evening came on, the still evening with its stars mirrored in the water.
The older lad, his endurance giving out, said: "Let go my hand, I am going to give you my watch."
He had received it as a present a few days before, and ever since it had been his chief amusement.
He was able to get hold of it, and held it out to the little fellow who was sobbing and who laid it down on the grass beside him.
It was night now.
The two unhappy beings, exhausted, had almost loosened their grasp.
The elder, at last, feeling that he was lost, murmured once more: "Good-by, little brother, kiss mamma and papa."
And his numbed fingers relaxed their hold.
He sank and did not rise again....
The little fellow, left alone, began to shout wildly: "Paul!
Paul!"
But the other did not come to the surface.
Then he darted across the mountain, falling among the stones, overcome by the most frightful anguish that can wring a child's heart, and with a face like death reached the sitting-room, where his parents were waiting.
He became bewildered again as he led them to the gloomy reservoir.
He could not find his way.
At last he reached the spot.
"It is there; yes, it is there!"
But the cistern had to be emptied, and the proprietor would not permit it as he needed the water for his lemon trees.
The two bodies were found, however, but not until the next day.
You see, my dear friend, that this is a simple news item.
But if you had seen the hole itself your heart would have been wrung, as mine was, at the thought of the agony of that child hanging to his brother's hands, of the long suspense of those little chaps who were accustomed only to laugh and to play, and at the simple incident of the giving of the watch.
I said to myself: "May Fate preserve me from ever receiving a similar relic!"
I know of nothing more terrible than such a recollection connected with a familiar object that one cannot dispose of.
Only think of it; each time that he handles this sacred watch the survivor will picture once more the horrible scene; the pool, the wall, the still water, and the distracted face of his brother-alive, and yet as lost as though he were already dead.
And all through his life, at any moment, the vision will be there, awakened the instant even the tip of his finger touches his watch pocket.
And I was sad until evening.
I left the spot and kept on climbing, leaving the region of orange trees for the region of olive trees, and the region of olive trees for the region of pines; then I came to a valley of stones, and finally reached the ruins of an ancient castle, built, they say, in the tenth century by a Saracen chief, a good man, who was baptized a Christian through love for a young girl.
Everywhere around me were mountains, and before me the sea, the sea with an almost imperceptible patch on it: Corsica, or, rather, the shadow of Corsica.
But on the mountain summits, blood-red in the glow of the sunset, in the boundless sky and on the sea, in all this superb landscape that I had come here to admire I saw only two poor children, one lying prone on the edge of a hole filled with black water, the other submerged to his neck, their hands intertwined, weeping opposite each other, in despair.
And it seemed as though I continually heard a weak, exhausted voice saying: "Good-by, little brother, I am going to give you my watch."
This letter may seem rather melancholy, dear friend.
I will try to be more cheerful some other day
==========
Last Monday an Indian prince died at Etretat, Bapu Sahib Khanderao Ghatay, a relation of His Highness, the Maharajah Gaikwar, prince of Baroda, in the province of Guzerat, Presidency of Bombay.
For about three weeks there had been seen walking in the streets about ten young East Indians, small, lithe, with dark skins, dressed all in gray and wearing on their heads caps such as English grooms wear.
They were men of high rank who had come to Europe to study the military institutions of the principal Western nations.
The little band consisted of three princes, a nobleman, an interpreter and three servants.
The head of the commission had just died, an old man of forty-two and father-in-law of Sampatro Kashivao Gaikwar, brother of His Highness, the Gaikwar of Baroda.
The son-in-law accompanied his father-in-law.
The other East Indians were called Ganpatrao Shravanrao Gaikwar, cousin of His Highness Khasherao Gadhav; Vasudev Madhav Samarth, interpreter and secretary; the slaves: Ramchandra Bajaji, Ganu bin Pukiram Kokate, Rhambhaji bin Fabji.
On leaving his native land the one who died recently was overcome with terrible grief, and feeling convinced that he would never return he wished to give up the journey, but he had to obey the wishes of his noble relative, the Prince of Baroda, and he set out.
They came to spend the latter part of the summer at Etretat, and people would go out of curiosity every morning to see them taking their bath at the Etablissment des Roches-Blanches.
Five or six days ago Bapu Sahib Khanderao Ghatay was taken with pains in his gums; then the inflammation spread to the throat and became ulceration.
Gangrene set in and, on Monday, the doctors told his young friends that their relative was dying.
The final struggle was already beginning, and the breath had almost left the unfortunate man's body when his friends seized him, snatched him from his bed and laid him on the stone floor of the room, so that, stretched out on the earth, our mother, he should yield up his soul, according to the command of Brahma.
They then sent to ask the mayor, M. Boissaye, for a permit to burn the body that very day so as to fulfill the prescribed ceremonial of the Hindoo religion.
The mayor hesitated, telegraphed to the prefecture to demand instructions, at the same time sending word that a failure to reply would be considered by him tantamount to a consent.
As he had received no reply at 9 o'clock that evening, he decided, in view of the infectious character of the disease of which the East Indian had died, that the cremation of the body should take place that very night, beneath the cliff, on the beach, at ebb tide.
The mayor is being criticized now for this decision, though he acted as an intelligent, liberal and determined man, and was upheld and advised by the three physicians who had watched the case and reported the death.
They were dancing at the Casino that evening.
It was an early autumn evening, rather chilly.
A pretty strong wind was blowing from the ocean, although as yet there was no sea on, and swift, light, ragged clouds were driving across the sky.
They came from the edge of the horizon, looking dark against the background of the sky, but as they approached the moon they grew whiter and passed hurriedly across her face, veiling it for a few seconds without completely hiding it.
The tall straight cliffs that inclose the rounded beach of Etretat and terminate in two celebrated arches, called "the Gates," lay in shadow, and made two great black patches in the softly lighted landscape.
It had rained all day.
The Casino orchestra was playing waltzes, polkas and quadrilles.
A rumor was presently circulated among the groups of dancers.
It was said that an East Indian prince had just died at the Hotel des Bains and that the ministry had been approached for permission to burn the body.
No one believed it, or at least no one supposed that such a thing could occur so foreign was the custom as yet to our customs, and as the night was far advanced every one went home.
At midnight, the lamplighter, running from street to street, extinguished, one after another, the yellow jets of flame that lighted up the sleeping houses, the mud and the puddles of water.
We waited, watching for the hour when the little town should be quiet and deserted.
Ever since noon a carpenter had been cutting up wood and asking himself with amazement what was going to be done with all these planks sawn up into little bits, and why one should destroy so much good merchandise.
This wood was piled up in a cart which went along through side streets as far as the beach, without arousing the suspicion of belated persons who might meet it.
It went along on the shingle at the foot of the cliff, and having dumped its contents on the beach the three Indian servants began to build a funeral pile, a little longer than it was wide.
They worked alone, for no profane hand must aid in this solemn duty.
It was one o'clock in the morning when the relations of the deceased were informed that they might accomplish their part of the work.
The door of the little house they occupied was open, and we perceived, lying on a stretcher in the small, dimly lighted vestibule the corpse covered with white silk.
We could see him plainly as he lay stretched out on his back, his outline clearly defined beneath this white veil.
The East Indians, standing at his feet, remained motionless, while one of them performed the prescribed rites, murmuring unfamiliar words in a low, monotonous tone.
He walked round and round the corpse; touching it occasionally, then, taking an urn suspended from three slender chains, he sprinkled it for some time with the sacred water of the Ganges, that East Indians must always carry with them wherever they go.
Then the stretcher was lifted by four of them who started off at a slow march.
The moon had gone down, leaving the muddy, deserted streets in darkness, but the body on the stretcher appeared to be luminous, so dazzlingly white was the silk, and it was a weird sight to see, passing along through the night, the semi-luminous form of this corpse, borne by those men, the dusky skin of whose faces and hands could scarcely be distinguished from their clothing in the darkness.
Behind the corpse came three Indians, and then, a full head taller than themselves and wrapped in an ample traveling coat of a soft gray color, appeared the outline of an Englishman, a kind and superior man, a friend of theirs, who was their guide and counselor in their European travels.
Beneath the cold, misty sky of this little northern beach I felt as if I were taking part in a sort of symbolical drama.
It seemed to me that they were carrying there, before me, the conquered genius of India, followed, as in a funeral procession, by the victorious genius of England robed in a gray ulster.
On the shingly beach the four bearers halted a few moments to take breath, and then proceeded on their way.
They now walked quickly, bending beneath the weight of their burden.
At length they reached the funeral pile.
It was erected in an indentation, at the very foot of the cliff, which rose above it perpendicularly a hundred meters high, perfectly white but looking gray in the night.
The funeral pile was about three and a half feet high.
The corpse was placed on it and then one of the Indians asked to have the pole star pointed out to him.
This was done, and the dead Rajah was laid with his feet turned towards his native country.
Then twelve bottles of kerosene were poured over him and he was covered completely with thin slabs of pine wood.
For almost another hour the relations and servants kept piling up the funeral pyre which looked like one of those piles of wood that carpenters keep in their yards.
Then on top of this was poured the contents of twenty bottles of oil, and on top of all they emptied a bag of fine shavings.
A few steps further on, a flame was glimmering in a little bronze brazier, which had remained lighted since the arrival of the corpse.
The moment had arrived.
The relations went to fetch the fire.
As it was barely alight, some oil was poured on it, and suddenly a flame arose lighting up the great wall of rock from summit to base.
An Indian who was leaning over the brazier rose upright, his two hands in the air, his elbows bent, and all at once we saw arising, all black on the immense white cliff, a colossal shadow, the shadow of Buddha in his hieratic posture.
And the little pointed toque that the man wore on his head even looked like the head-dress of the god.
The effect was so striking and unexpected that I felt my heart beat as though some supernatural apparition had risen up before me.
That was just what it was—the ancient and sacred image, come from the heart of the East to the ends of Europe, and watching over its son whom they were going to cremate there.
It vanished.
They brought fire.
The shavings on top of the pyre were lighted and then the wood caught fire and a brilliant light illumined the cliff, the shingle and the foam of the waves as they broke on the beach.
It grew brighter from second to second, lighting up on the sea in the distance the dancing crest of the waves.
The breeze from the ocean blew in gusts, increasing the heat of the flame which flattened down, twisted, then shot up again, throwing out millions of sparks.
They mounted with wild rapidity along the cliff and were lost in the sky, mingling with the stars, increasing their number.
Some sea birds who had awakened uttered their plaintive cry, and, describing long curves, flew, with their white wings extended, through the gleam from the funeral pyre and then disappeared in the night.
Before long the pile of wood was nothing but a mass of flame, not red but yellow, a blinding yellow, a furnace lashed by the wind.
And, suddenly, beneath a stronger gust, it tottered, partially crumbling as it leaned towards the sea, and the corpse came to view, full length, blackened on his couch of flame and burning with long blue flames:
The pile of wood having crumbled further on the right the corpse turned over as a man does in bed.
They immediately covered him with fresh wood and the fire started up again more furiously than ever.
The East Indians, seated in a semi-circle on the shingle, looked out with sad, serious faces.
And the rest of us, as it was very cold, had drawn nearer to the fire until the smoke and sparks came in our faces.
There was no odor save that of burning pine and petroleum.
Hours passed; day began to break.
Toward five o'clock in the morning nothing remained but a heap of ashes.
The relations gathered them up, cast some of them to the winds, some in the sea, and kept some in a brass vase that they had brought from India.
They then retired to their home to give utterance to lamentations.
These young princes and their servants, by the employment of the most inadequate appliances succeeded in carrying out the cremation of their relation in the most perfect manner, with singular skill and remarkable dignity.
Everything was done according to ritual, according to the rigid ordinances of their religion.
Their dead one rests in peace.
The following morning at daybreak there was an indescribable commotion in Etretat.
Some insisted that they had burned a man alive, others that they were trying to hide a crime, some that the mayor would be put in jail, others that the Indian prince had succumbed to an attack of cholera.
The men were amazed, the women indignant.
A crowd of people spent the day on the site of the funeral pile, looking for fragments of bone in the shingle that was still warm.
They found enough bones to reconstruct ten skeletons, for the farmers on shore frequently throw their dead sheep into the sea.
The finders carefully placed these various fragments in their pocketbooks.
But not one of them possesses a true particle of the Indian prince.
That very night a deputy sent by the government came to hold an inquest.
He, however, formed an estimate of this singular case like a man of intelligence and good sense.
But what should he say in his report?
The East Indians declared that if they had been prevented in France from cremating their dead they would have taken him to a freer country where they could have carried out their customs.
Thus, I have seen a man cremated on a funeral pile, and it has given me a wish to disappear in the same manner.
In this way everything ends at once.
Man expedites the slow work of nature, instead of delaying it by the hideous coffin in which one decomposes for months.
The flesh is dead, the spirit has fled.
Fire which purifies disperses in a few hours all that was a human being; it casts it to the winds, converting it into air and ashes, and not into ignominious corruption.
This is clean and hygienic.
Putrefaction beneath the ground in a closed box where the body becomes like pap, a blackened, stinking pap, has about it something repugnant and disgusting.
The sight of the coffin as it descends into this muddy hole wrings one's heart with anguish.
But the funeral pyre which flames up beneath the sky has about it something grand, beautiful and solemn
==========
I was very much interested at that time in a droll little woman.
She was married, of course, as I have a horror of unmarried flirts.
What enjoyment is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs to any one?
And, besides, morality aside, I do not understand love as a trade.
That disgusts me somewhat.
The especial attraction in a married woman to a bachelor is that she gives him a home, a sweet, pleasant home where every one takes care of you and spoils you, from the husband to the servants.
One finds everything combined there, love, friendship, even fatherly interest, bed and board, all, in fact, that constitutes the happiness of life, with this incalculable advantage, that one can change one's family from time to time, take up one's abode in all kinds of society in turn: in summer, in the country with the workman who rents you a room in his house; in winter with the townsfolk, or even with the nobility, if one is ambitious.
I have another weakness; it is that I become attached to the husband as well as the wife.
I acknowledge even that some husbands, ordinary or coarse as they may be, give me a feeling of disgust for their wives, however charming they may be.
But when the husband is intellectual or charming I invariably become very much attached to him.
I am careful if I quarrel with the wife not to quarrel with the husband.
In this way I have made some of my best friends, and have also proved in many cases the incontestable superiority of the male over the female in the human species.
The latter makes all sorts of trouble-scenes, reproaches, etc.
; while the former, who has just as good a right to complain, treats you, on the contrary, as though you were the special Providence of his hearth.
Well, my friend was a quaint little woman, a brunette, fanciful, capricious, pious, superstitious, credulous as a monk, but charming.
She had a way of kissing one that I never saw in any one else—but that was not the attraction—and such a soft skin!
It gave me intense delight merely to hold her hands.
And an eye—her glance was like a slow caress, delicious and unending.
Sometimes I would lean my head on her knee and we would remain motionless, she leaning over me with that subtle, enigmatic, disturbing smile that women have, while my eyes would be raised to hers, drinking sweetly and deliciously into my heart, like a form of intoxication, the glance of her limpid blue eyes, limpid as though they were full of thoughts of love, and blue as though they were a heaven of delights.
Her husband, inspector of some large public works, was frequently away from home and left us our evenings free.
Sometimes I spent them with her lounging on the divan with my forehead on one of her knees; while on the other lay an enormous black cat called "Misti," whom she adored.
Our fingers would meet on the cat's back and would intertwine in her soft silky fur.
I felt its warm body against my cheek, trembling with its eternal purring, and occasionally a paw would reach out and place on my mouth, or my eyelid, five unsheathed claws which would prick my eyelids, and then be immediately withdrawn.
Sometimes we would go out on what we called our escapades.
They were very innocent, however.
They consisted in taking supper at some inn in the suburbs, or else, after dining at her house or at mine, in making the round of the cheap cafes, like students out for a lark.
We would go into the common drinking places and take our seats at the end of the smoky den on two rickety chairs, at an old wooden table.
A cloud of pungent smoke, with which blended an odor of fried fish from dinner, filled the room.
Men in smocks were talking in loud tones as they drank their petits verres, and the astonished waiter placed before us two cherry brandies.
She, trembling, charmingly afraid, would raise her double black veil as far as her nose, and then take up her glass with the enjoyment that one feels at doing something delightfully naughty.
Each cherry she swallowed made her feel as if she had done something wrong, each swallow of the burning liquor had on her the affect of a delicate and forbidden enjoyment.
Then she would say to me in a low tone: "Let us go."
And we would leave, she walking quickly with lowered head between the drinkers who watched her going by with a look of displeasure.
And as soon as we got into the street she would give a great sigh of relief, as if we had escaped some terrible danger.
Sometimes she would ask me with a shudder:
"Suppose they, should say something rude to me in those places, what would you do?"
"Why, I would defend you, parbleu!"
I would reply in a resolute manner.
And she would squeeze my arm for happiness, perhaps with a vague wish that she might be insulted and protected, that she might see men fight on her account, even those men, with me!
One evening as we sat at a table in a tavern at Montmartre, we saw an old woman in tattered garments come in, holding in her hand a pack of dirty cards.
Perceiving a lady, the old woman at once approached us and offered to tell my friend's fortune.
Emma, who in her heart believed in everything, was trembling with longing and anxiety, and she made a place beside her for the old woman.
The latter, old, wrinkled, her eyes with red inflamed rings round them, and her mouth without a single tooth in it, began to deal her dirty cards on the table.
She dealt them in piles, then gathered them up, and then dealt them out again, murmuring indistinguishable words.
Emma, turning pale, listened with bated breath, gasping with anxiety and curiosity.
The fortune-teller broke silence.
She predicted vague happenings: happiness and children, a fair young man, a voyage, money, a lawsuit, a dark man, the return of some one, success, a death.
The mention of this death attracted the younger woman's attention.
"Whose death?
When?
In what manner?"
The old woman replied: "Oh, as to that, these cards are not certain enough.
You must come to my place to-morrow; I will tell you about it with coffee grounds which never make a mistake."
Emma turned anxiously to me:
"Say, let us go there to-morrow.
Oh, please say yes.
If not, you cannot imagine how worried I shall be."
I began to laugh.
"We will go if you wish it, dearie."
The old woman gave us her address.
She lived on the sixth floor, in a wretched house behind the Buttes-Chaumont.
We went there the following day.
Her room, an attic containing two chairs and a bed, was filled with strange objects, bunches of herbs hanging from nails, skins of animals, flasks and phials containing liquids of various colors.
On the table a stuffed black cat looked out of eyes of glass.
He seemed like the demon of this sinister dwelling.
Emma, almost fainting with emotion, sat down on a chair and exclaimed:
"Oh, dear, look at that cat; how like it is to Misti."
And she explained to the old woman that she had a cat "exactly like that, exactly like that!"
The old woman replied gravely:
"If you are in love with a man, you must not keep it."
Emma, suddenly filled with fear, asked:
"Why not?"
The old woman sat down familiarly beside her and took her hand.
"It was the undoing of my life," she said.
My friend wanted to hear about it.
She leaned against the old woman, questioned her, begged her to tell.
At length the woman agreed to do so.
"I loved that cat," she said, "as one would love a brother.
I was young then and all alone, a seamstress.
I had only him, Mouton.
One of the tenants had given it to me.
He was as intelligent as a child, and gentle as well, and he worshiped me, my dear lady, he worshiped me more than one does a fetish.
All day long he would sit on my lap purring, and all night long on my pillow; I could feel his heart beating, in fact.
"Well, I happened to make an acquaintance, a fine young man who was working in a white-goods house.
That went on for about three months on a footing of mere friendship.
But you know one is liable to weaken, it may happen to any one, and, besides, I had really begun to love him.
He was so nice, so nice, and so good.
He wanted us to live together, for economy's sake.
I finally allowed him to come and see me one evening.
I had not made up my mind to anything definite; oh, no!
But I was pleased at the idea that we should spend an hour together.
"At first he behaved very well, said nice things to me that made my heart go pit-a-pat.
And then he kissed me, madame, kissed me as one does when they love.
I remained motionless, my eyes closed, in a paroxysm of happiness.
But, suddenly, I felt him start violently and he gave a scream, a scream that I shall never forget.
I opened my eyes and saw that Mouton had sprung at his face and was tearing the skin with his claws as if it had been a linen rag.
And the blood was streaming down like rain, madame.
"I tried to take the cat away, but he held on tight, scratching all the time; and he bit me, he was so crazy.
I finally got him and threw him out of the window, which was open, for it was summer.
"When I began to bathe my poor friend's face, I noticed that his eyes were destroyed, both his eyes!
"He had to go to the hospital.
He died of grief at the end of a year.
I wanted to keep him with me and provide for him, but he would not agree to it.
One would have supposed that he hated me after the occurrence.
"As for Mouton, his back was broken by the fall, The janitor picked up his body.
I had him stuffed, for in spite of all I was fond of him.
If he acted as he did it was because he loved me, was it not?"
The old woman was silent and began to stroke the lifeless animal whose body trembled on its iron framework.
Emma, with sorrowful heart, had forgotten about the predicted death—or, at least, she did not allude to it again, and she left, giving the woman five francs.
As her husband was to return the following day, I did not go to the house for several days.
When I did go I was surprised at not seeing Misti.
I asked where he was.
She blushed and replied:
"I gave him away.
I was uneasy."
I was astonished.
"Uneasy?
Uneasy?
==========
Crazy people attract me.
They live in a mysterious land of weird dreams, in that impenetrable cloud of dementia where all that they have witnessed in their previous life, all they have loved, is reproduced for them in an imaginary existence, outside of all laws that govern the things of this life and control human thought.
For them there is no such thing as the impossible, nothing is improbable; fairyland is a constant quantity and the supernatural quite familiar.
The old rampart, logic; the old wall, reason; the old main stay of thought, good sense, break down, fall and crumble before their imagination, set free and escaped into the limitless realm of fancy, and advancing with fabulous bounds, and nothing can check it.
For them everything happens, and anything may happen.
They make no effort to conquer events, to overcome resistance, to overturn obstacles.
By a sudden caprice of their flighty imagination they become princes, emperors, or gods, are possessed of all the wealth of the world, all the delightful things of life, enjoy all pleasures, are always strong, always beautiful, always young, always beloved!
They, alone, can be happy in this world; for, as far as they are concerned, reality does not exist.
I love to look into their wandering intelligence as one leans over an abyss at the bottom of which seethes a foaming torrent whose source and destination are both unknown.
But it is in vain that we lean over these abysses, for we shall never discover the source nor the destination of this water.
After all, it is only water, just like what is flowing in the sunlight, and we shall learn nothing by looking at it.
It is likewise of no use to ponder over the intelligence of crazy people, for their most weird notions are, in fact, only ideas that are already known, which appear strange simply because they are no longer under the restraint of reason.
Their whimsical source surprises us because we do not see it bubbling up.
Doubtless the dropping of a little stone into the current was sufficient to cause these ebullitions.
Nevertheless crazy people attract me and I always return to them, drawn in spite of myself by this trivial mystery of dementia.
One day as I was visiting one of the asylums the physician who was my guide said:
"Come, I will show you an interesting case."
And he opened the door of a cell where a woman of about forty, still handsome, was seated in a large armchair, looking persistently at her face in a little hand mirror.
As soon as she saw us she rose to her feet, ran to the other end of the room, picked up a veil that lay on a chair, wrapped it carefully round her face, then came back, nodding her head in reply to our greeting.
"Well," said the doctor, "how are you this morning?"
She gave a deep sigh.
"Oh, ill, monsieur, very ill.
The marks are increasing every day."
He replied in a tone of conviction:
"Oh, no; oh, no; I assure you that you are mistaken."
She drew near to him and murmured:
"No.
I am certain of it.
I counted ten pittings more this morning, three on the right cheek, four on the left cheek, and three on the forehead.
It is frightful, frightful!
I shall never dare to let any one see me, not even my son; no, not even him!
I am lost, I am disfigured forever."
She fell back in her armchair and began to sob.
The doctor took a chair, sat down beside her, and said soothingly in a gentle tone:
"Come, let me see; I assure you it is nothing.
With a slight cauterization I will make it all disappear."
She shook her head in denial, without speaking.
He tried to touch her veil, but she seized it with both hands so violently that her fingers went through it.
He continued to reason with her and reassure her.
"Come, you know very well that I remove those horrid pits every time and that there is no trace of them after I have treated them.
If you do not let me see them I cannot cure you."
"I do not mind your seeing them," she murmured, "but I do not know that gentleman who is with you."
"He is a doctor also, who can give you better care than I can."
She then allowed her face to be uncovered, but her dread, her emotion, her shame at being seen brought a rosy flush to her face and her neck, down to the collar of her dress.
She cast down her eyes, turned her face aside, first to the right; then to the left, to avoid our gaze and stammered out:
"Oh, it is torture to me to let myself be seen like this!
It is horrible, is it not?
Is it not horrible?"
I looked at her in much surprise, for there was nothing on her face, not a mark, not a spot, not a sign of one, nor a scar.
She turned towards me, her eyes still lowered, and said:
"It was while taking care of my son that I caught this fearful disease, monsieur.
I saved him, but I am disfigured.
I sacrificed my beauty to him, to my poor child.
However, I did my duty, my conscience is at rest.
If I suffer it is known only to God."
The doctor had drawn from his coat pocket a fine water-color paint brush.
"Let me attend to it," he said, "I will put it all right."
She held out her right cheek, and he began by touching it lightly with the brush here and there, as though he were putting little points of paint on it.
He did the same with the left cheek, then with the chin, and the forehead, and then exclaimed:
"See, there is nothing there now, nothing at all!"
She took up the mirror, gazed at her reflection with profound, eager attention, with a strong mental effort to discover something, then she sighed:
"No.
It hardly shows at all.
I am infinitely obliged to you."
The doctor had risen.
He bowed to her, ushered me out and followed me, and, as soon as he had locked the door, said:
"Here is the history of this unhappy woman."
Her name is Mme.
Hermet.
She was once very beautiful, a great coquette, very much beloved and very much in-love with life.
She was one of those women who have nothing but their beauty and their love of admiration to sustain, guide or comfort them in this life.
The constant anxiety to retain her freshness, the care of her complexion, of her hands, her teeth, of every portion of body that was visible, occupied all her time and all her attention.
She became a widow, with one son.
The boy was brought up as are all children of society beauties.
She was, however, very fond of him.
He grew up, and she grew older.
Whether she saw the fatal crisis approaching, I cannot say.
Did she, like so many others, gaze for hours and hours at her skin, once so fine, so transparent and free from blemish, now beginning to shrivel slightly, to be crossed with a thousand little lines, as yet imperceptible, that will grow deeper day by day, month by month?
Did she also see slowly, but surely, increasing traces of those long wrinkles on the forehead, those slender serpents that nothing can check?
Did she suffer the torture, the abominable torture of the mirror, the little mirror with the silver handle which one cannot make up one's mind to lay down on the table, but then throws down in disgust only to take it up again in order to look more closely, and still more closely at the hateful and insidious approaches of old age?
Did she shut herself up ten times, twenty times a day, leaving her friends chatting in the drawing-room, and go up to her room where, under the protection of bolts and bars, she would again contemplate the work of time on her ripe beauty, now beginning to wither, and recognize with despair the gradual progress of the process which no one else had as yet seemed to perceive, but of which she, herself, was well aware.
She knows where to seek the most serious, the gravest traces of age.
And the mirror, the little round hand-glass in its carved silver frame, tells her horrible things; for it speaks, it seems to laugh, it jeers and tells her all that is going to occur, all the physical discomforts and the atrocious mental anguish she will suffer until the day of her death, which will be the day of her deliverance.
Did she weep, distractedly, on her knees, her forehead to the ground, and pray, pray, pray to Him who thus slays his creatures and gives them youth only that he may render old age more unendurable, and lends them beauty only that he may withdraw it almost immediately?
Did she pray to Him, imploring Him to do for her what He has never yet done for any one, to let her retain until her last day her charm, her freshness and her gracefulness?
Then, finding that she was imploring in vain an inflexible Unknown who drives on the years, one after another, did she roll on the carpet in her room, knocking her head against the furniture and stifling in her throat shrieks of despair?
Doubtless she suffered these tortures, for this is what occurred:
One day (she was then thirty-five) her son aged fifteen, fell ill.
He took to his bed without any one being able to determine the cause or nature of his illness.
His tutor, a priest, watched beside him and hardly ever left him, while Mme.
Hermet came morning and evening to inquire how he was.
She would come into the room in the morning in her night wrapper, smiling, all powdered and perfumed, and would ask as she entered the door:
"Well, George, are you better?"
The big boy, his face red, swollen and showing the ravages of fever, would reply:
"Yes, little mother, a little better."
She would stay in the room a few seconds, look at the bottles of medicine, and purse her lips as if she were saying "phew," and then would suddenly exclaim: "Oh, I forgot something very important," and would run out of the room leaving behind her a fragrance of choice toilet perfumes.
In the evening she would appear in a decollete dress, in a still greater hurry, for she was always late, and she had just time to inquire:
"Well, what does the doctor say?"
The priest would reply:
"He has not yet given an opinion, madame."
But one evening the abbe replied: "Madame, your son has got the small-pox."
She uttered a scream of terror and fled from the room.
When her maid came to her room the following morning she noticed at once a strong odor of burnt sugar, and she found her mistress, with wide-open eyes, her face pale from lack of sleep, and shivering with terror in her bed.
As soon as the shutters were opened Mme.
Herrnet asked:
"How is George?"
"Oh, not at all well to-day, madame."
She did not rise until noon, when she ate two eggs with a cup of tea, as if she herself had been ill, and then she went out to a druggist's to inquire about prophylactic measures against the contagion of small-pox.
She did not come home until dinner time, laden with medicine bottles, and shut herself up at once in her room, where she saturated herself with disinfectants.
The priest was waiting for her in the dining-room.
As soon as she saw him she exclaimed in a voice full of emotion:
"Well?"
"No improvement.
The doctor is very anxious:"
She began to cry and could eat nothing, she was so worried.
The next day, as soon as it was light, she sent to inquire for her son, but there was no improvement and she spent the whole day in her room, where little braziers were giving out pungent odors.
Her maid said also that you could hear her sighing all the evening.
She spent a whole week in this manner, only going out for an hour or two during the afternoon to breathe the air.
She now sent to make inquiries every hour, and would sob when the reports were unfavorable.
On the morning of the eleventh day the priest, having been announced, entered her room, his face grave and pale, and said, without taking the chair she offered him:
"Madame, your son is very ill and wishes to see you."
She fell on her knees, exclaiming:
"Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I would never dare!
My God!
My God!
Help me!"
The priest continued:
"The doctor holds out little hope, madame, and George is expecting you!"
And he left the room.
Two hours later as the young lad, feeling himself dying, again asked for his mother, the abbe went to her again and found her still on her knees, still weeping and repeating:
"I will not....
I will not....
I am too much afraid....
I will not...."
He tried to persuade her, to strengthen her, to lead her.
He only succeeded in bringing on an attack of "nerves" that lasted some time and caused her to shriek.
The doctor when he came in the evening was told of this cowardice and declared that he would bring her in himself, of her own volition, or by force.
But after trying all manner of argument and just as he seized her round the waist to carry her into her son's room, she caught hold of the door and clung to it so firmly that they could not drag her away.
Then when they let go of her she fell at the feet of the doctor, begging his forgiveness and acknowledging that she was a wretched creature.
And then she exclaimed: "Oh, he is not going to die; tell me that he is not going to die, I beg of you; tell him that I love him, that I worship him..."
The young lad was dying.
Feeling that he had only a few moments more to live, he entreated that his mother be persuaded to come and bid him a last farewell.
With that sort of presentiment that the dying sometimes have, he had understood, had guessed all, and he said: "If she is afraid to come into the room, beg her just to come on the balcony as far as my window so that I may see her, at least, so that I may take a farewell look at her, as I cannot kiss her."
The doctor and the abbe, once more, went together to this woman and assured her: "You will run no risk, for there will be a pane of glass between you and him."
She consented, covered up her head, and took with her a bottle of smelling salts.
She took three steps on the balcony; then, all at once, hiding her face in her hands, she moaned: "No... no...
I would never dare to look at him... never....
I am too much ashamed... too much afraid.... No...
I cannot."
They endeavored to drag her along, but she held on with both hands to the railings and uttered such plaints that the passers-by in the street raised their heads.
And the dying boy waited, his eyes turned towards that window, waited to die until he could see for the last time the sweet, beloved face, the worshiped face of his mother.
He waited long, and night came on.
Then he turned over with his face to the wall and was silent.
When day broke he was dead.
The day following she was crazy
==========
The Seine flowed past my house, without a ripple on its surface, and gleaming in the bright morning sunlight.
It was a beautiful, broad, indolent silver stream, with crimson lights here and there; and on the opposite side of the river were rows of tall trees that covered all the bank with an immense wall of verdure.
The sensation of life which is renewed each day, of fresh, happy, loving life trembled in the leaves, palpitated in the air, was mirrored in the water.
The postman had just brought my papers, which were handed to me, and I walked slowly to the river bank in order to read them.
In the first paper I opened I noticed this headline, "Statistics of Suicides," and I read that more than 8,500 persons had killed themselves in that year.
In a moment I seemed to see them!
I saw this voluntary and hideous massacre of the despairing who were weary of life.
I saw men bleeding, their jaws fractured, their skulls cloven, their breasts pierced by a bullet, slowly dying, alone in a little room in a hotel, giving no thought to their wound, but thinking only of their misfortunes.
I saw others seated before a tumbler in which some matches were soaking, or before a little bottle with a red label.
They would look at it fixedly without moving; then they would drink and await the result; then a spasm would convulse their cheeks and draw their lips together; their eyes would grow wild with terror, for they did not know that the end would be preceded by so much suffering.
They rose to their feet, paused, fell over and with their hands pressed to their stomachs they felt their internal organs on fire, their entrails devoured by the fiery liquid, before their minds began to grow dim.
I saw others hanging from a nail in the wall, from the fastening of the window, from a hook in the ceiling, from a beam in the garret, from a branch of a tree amid the evening rain.
And I surmised all that had happened before they hung there motionless, their tongues hanging out of their mouths.
I imagined the anguish of their heart, their final hesitation, their attempts to fasten the rope, to determine that it was secure, then to pass the noose round their neck and to let themselves fall.
I saw others lying on wretched beds, mothers with their little children, old men dying of hunger, young girls dying for love, all rigid, suffocated, asphyxiated, while in the center of the room the brasier still gave forth the fumes of charcoal.
And I saw others walking at night along the deserted bridges.
These were the most sinister.
The water flowed under the arches with a low sound.
They did not see it... they guessed at it from its cool breath!
They longed for it and they feared it.
They dared not do it!
And yet, they must.
A distant clock sounded the hour and, suddenly, in the vast silence of the night, there was heard the splash of a body falling into the river, a scream or two, the sound of hands beating the water, and all was still.
Sometimes, even, there was only the sound of the falling body when they had tied their arms down or fastened a stone to their feet.
Oh, the poor things, the poor things, the poor things, how I felt their anguish, how I died in their death!
I went through all their wretchedness; I endured in one hour all their tortures.
I knew all the sorrows that had led them to this, for I know the deceitful infamy of life, and no one has felt it more than I have.
How I understood them, these who weak, harassed by misfortune, having lost those they loved, awakened from the dream of a tardy compensation, from the illusion of another existence where God will finally be just, after having been ferocious, and their minds disabused of the mirages of happiness, have given up the fight and desire to put an end to this ceaseless tragedy, or this shameful comedy.
Suicide!
Why, it is the strength of those whose strength is exhausted, the hope of those who no longer believe, the sublime courage of the conquered!
Yes, there is at least one door to this life we can always open and pass through to the other side.
Nature had an impulse of pity; she did not shut us up in prison.
Mercy for the despairing!
As for those who are simply disillusioned, let them march ahead with free soul and quiet heart.
They have nothing to fear since they may take their leave; for behind them there is always this door that the gods of our illusions cannot even lock.
I thought of this crowd of suicides: more than eight thousand five hundred in one year.
And it seemed to me that they had combined to send to the world a prayer, to utter a cry of appeal, to demand something that should come into effect later when we understood things better.
It seemed to me that all these victims, their throats cut, poisoned, hung, asphyxiated, or drowned, all came together, a frightful horde, like citizens to the polls, to say to society:
"Grant us, at least, a gentle death!
Help us to die, you who will not help us to live!
See, we are numerous, we have the right to speak in these days of freedom, of philosophic independence and of popular suffrage.
Give to those who renounce life the charity of a death that will not be repugnant nor terrible."
I began to dream, allowing my fancy to roam at will in weird and mysterious fashion on this subject.
I seemed to be all at once in a beautiful city.
It was Paris; but at what period?
I walked about the streets, looking at the houses, the theaters, the public buildings, and presently found myself in a square where I remarked a large building; very handsome, dainty and attractive.
I was surprised on reading on the facade this inscription in letters of gold, "Suicide Bureau."
Oh, the weirdness of waking dreams where the spirit soars into a world of unrealities and possibilities!
Nothing astonishes one, nothing shocks one; and the unbridled fancy makes no distinction between the comic and the tragic.
I approached the building where footmen in knee-breeches were seated in the vestibule in front of a cloak-room as they do at the entrance of a club.
I entered out of curiosity.
One of the men rose and said:
"What does monsieur wish?"
"I wish to know what building this is."
"Nothing more?"
"Why, no."
"Then would monsieur like me to take him to the Secretary of the Bureau?"
I hesitated, and asked:
"But will not that disturb him?"
"Oh, no, monsieur, he is here to receive those who desire information."
"Well, lead the way."
He took me through corridors where old gentlemen were chatting, and finally led me into a beautiful office, somewhat somber, furnished throughout in black wood.
A stout young man with a corporation was writing a letter as he smoked a cigar, the fragrance of which gave evidence of its quality.
He rose.
We bowed to each other, and as soon as the footman had retired he asked:
"What can I do for you?"
"Monsieur," I replied, "pardon my curiosity.
I had never seen this establishment.
The few words inscribed on the facade filled me with astonishment, and I wanted to know what was going on here."
He smiled before replying, then said in a low tone with a complacent air:
"Mon Dieu, monsieur, we put to death in a cleanly and gentle—I do not venture to say agreeable manner those persons who desire to die."
I did not feel very shocked, for it really seemed to me natural and right.
What particularly surprised me was that on this planet, with its low, utilitarian, humanitarian ideals, selfish and coercive of all true freedom, any one should venture on a similar enterprise, worthy of an emancipated humanity.
"How did you get the idea?"
I asked.
"Monsieur," he replied, "the number of suicides increased so enormously during the five years succeeding the world exposition of 1889 that some measures were urgently needed.
People killed themselves in the streets, at fetes, in restaurants, at the theater, in railway carriages, at the receptions held by the President of the Republic, everywhere.
It was not only a horrid sight for those who love life, as I do, but also a bad example for children.
Hence it became necessary to centralize suicides."
"What caused this suicidal epidemic?"
"I do not know.
The fact is, I believe, the world is growing old.
People begin to see things clearly and they are getting disgruntled.
It is the same to-day with destiny as with the government, we have found out what it is; people find that they are swindled in every direction, and they just get out of it all.
When one discovers that Providence lies, cheats, robs, deceives human beings just as a plain Deputy deceives his constituents, one gets angry, and as one cannot nominate a fresh Providence every three months as we do with our privileged representatives, one just gets out of the whole thing, which is decidedly bad."
"Really!"
"Oh, as for me, I am not complaining."
"Will you inform me how you carry on this establishment?"
"With pleasure.
You may become a member when you please.
It is a club."
"A club!"
"Yes, monsieur, founded by the most eminent men in the country, by men of the highest intellect and brightest intelligence.
And," he added, laughing heartily, "I swear to you that every one gets a great deal of enjoyment out of it."
"In this place?"
"Yes, in this place."
"You surprise me."
"Mon Dieu, they enjoy themselves because they have not that fear of death which is the great killjoy in all our earthly pleasures."
"But why should they be members of this club if they do not kill themselves?"
"One may be a member of the club without being obliged for that reason to commit suicide."
"But then?"
"I will explain.
In view of the enormous increase in suicides, and of the hideous spectacle they presented, a purely benevolent society was formed for the protection of those in despair, which placed at their disposal the facilities for a peaceful, painless, if not unforeseen death."
"Who can have authorized such an institution?"
"General Boulanger during his brief tenure of power.
He could never refuse anything.
However, that was the only good thing he did.
Hence, a society was formed of clear-sighted, disillusioned skeptics who desired to erect in the heart of Paris a kind of temple dedicated to the contempt for death.
This place was formerly a dreaded spot that no one ventured to approach.
Then its founders, who met together here, gave a grand inaugural entertainment with Mmes.
Sarah Bernhardt, Judic, Theo, Granier, and twenty others, and Mme.
de Reske, Coquelin, Mounet-Sully, Paulus, etc., present, followed by concerts, the comedies of Dumas, of Meilhac, Halevy and Sardon.
We had only one thing to mar it, one drama by Becque which seemed sad, but which subsequently had a great success at the Comedie-Francaise.
In fact all Paris came.
The enterprise was launched."
"In the midst of the festivities!
What a funereal joke!"
"Not at all.
Death need not be sad, it should be a matter of indifference.
We made death cheerful, crowned it with flowers, covered it with perfume, made it easy.
One learns to aid others through example; one can see that it is nothing."
"I can well understand that they should come to the entertainments; but did they come to...
Death?"
"Not at first; they were afraid."
"And later?"
"They came."
"Many of them?"
"In crowds.
We have had more than forty in a day.
One finds hardly any more drowned bodies in the Seine."
"Who was the first?"
"A club member."
"As a sacrifice to the cause?"
"I don't think so.
A man who was sick of everything, a 'down and out' who had lost heavily at baccarat for three months."
"Indeed?"
"The second was an Englishman, an eccentric.
We then advertised in the papers, we gave an account of our methods, we invented some attractive instances.
But the great impetus was given by poor people."
"How do you go to work?"
"Would you like to see?
I can explain at the same time."
"Yes, indeed."
He took his hat, opened the door, allowed me to precede him, and we entered a card room, where men sat playing as they, play in all gambling places.
They were chatting cheerfully, eagerly.
I have seldom seen such a jolly, lively, mirthful club.
As I seemed surprised, the secretary said:
"Oh, the establishment has an unheard of prestige.
All the smart people all over the world belong to it so as to appear as though they held death in scorn.
Then, once they get here, they feel obliged to be cheerful that they may not appear to be afraid.
So they joke and laugh and talk flippantly, they are witty and they become so.
At present it is certainly the most frequented and the most entertaining place in Paris.
The women are even thinking of building an annex for themselves."
"And, in spite of all this, you have many suicides in the house?"
"As I said, about forty or fifty a day.
Society people are rare, but poor devils abound.
The middle class has also a large contingent.
"And how... do they do?"
"They are asphyxiated... very slowly."
"In what manner?"
"A gas of our own invention.
We have the patent.
On the other side of the building are the public entrances—three little doors opening on small streets.
When a man or a woman present themselves they are interrogated.
Then they are offered assistance, aid, protection.
If a client accepts, inquiries are made; and sometimes we have saved their lives."
"Where do you get your money?"
"We have a great deal.
There are a large number of shareholders.
Besides it is fashionable to contribute to the establishment.
The names of the donors are published in Figaro.
Then the suicide of every rich man costs a thousand francs.
And they look as if they were lying in state.
It costs the poor nothing."
"How can you tell who is poor?"
"Oh, oh, monsieur, we can guess!
And, besides, they must bring a certificate of indigency from the commissary of police of their district.
If you knew how distressing it is to see them come in!
I visited their part of our building once only, and I will never go again.
The place itself is almost as good as this part, almost as luxurious and comfortable; but they themselves... they themselves!!!
If you could see them arriving, the old men in rags coming to die; persons who have been dying of misery for months, picking up their food at the edges of the curbstone like dogs in the street; women in rags, emaciated, sick, paralyzed, incapable of making a living, who say to us after they have told us their story: 'You see that things cannot go on like that, as I cannot work any longer or earn anything.'
I saw one woman of eighty-seven who had lost all her children and grandchildren, and who for the last six weeks had been sleeping out of doors.
It made me ill to hear of it.
Then we have so many different cases, without counting those who say nothing, but simply ask: 'Where is it?'
These are admitted at once and it is all over in a minute."
With a pang at my heart I repeated:
"And... where is it?"
"Here," and he opened a door, adding:
"Go in; this is the part specially reserved for club members, and the one least used.
We have so far had only eleven annihilations here."
"Ah!
You call that an...
annihilation!"
"Yes, monsieur.
Go in."
I hesitated.
At length I went in.
It was a wide corridor, a sort of greenhouse in which panes of glass of pale blue, tender pink and delicate green gave the poetic charm of landscapes to the inclosing walls.
In this pretty salon there were divans, magnificent palms, flowers, especially roses of balmy fragrance, books on the tables, the Revue des Deuxmondes, cigars in government boxes, and, what surprised me, Vichy pastilles in a bonbonniere.
As I expressed my surprise, my guide said:
"Oh, they often come here to chat."
He continued: "The public corridors are similar, but more simply furnished."
In reply to a question of mine, he pointed to a couch covered with creamy crepe de Chine with white embroidery, beneath a large shrub of unknown variety at the foot of which was a circular bed of mignonette.
The secretary added in a lower tone:
"We change the flower and the perfume at will, for our gas, which is quite imperceptible, gives death the fragrance of the suicide's favorite flower.
It is volatilized with essences.
Would you like to inhale it for a second?"
"'No, thank you," I said hastily, "not yet...."
He began to laugh.
"Oh, monsieur, there is no danger.
I have tried it myself several times."
I was afraid he would think me a coward, and I said:
"Well, I'll try it."
"Stretch yourself out on the 'endormeuse."'
A little uneasy I seated myself on the low couch covered with crepe de Chine and stretched myself full length, and was at once bathed in a delicious odor of mignonette.
I opened my mouth in order to breathe it in, for my mind had already become stupefied and forgetful of the past and was a prey, in the first stages of asphyxia, to the enchanting intoxication of a destroying and magic opium.
Some one shook me by the arm.
"Oh, oh, monsieur," said the secretary, laughing, "it looks to me as if you were almost caught."
But a voice, a real voice, and no longer a dream voice, greeted me with the peasant intonation:
"Good morning, m'sieu.
How goes it?"
My dream was over.
I saw the Seine distinctly in the sunlight, and, coming along a path, the garde champetre of the district, who with his right hand touched his kepi braided in silver.
I replied:
"Good morning, Marinel.
Where are you going?"
